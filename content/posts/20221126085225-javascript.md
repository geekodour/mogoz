## Data types and values {#data-types-and-values}


### Values {#values}


#### Primitive(7) {#primitive--7}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221126085225-javascript-970466739.png" >}}

-   Immutable
-   undefined, number, string, boolean, symbol, bigint are not `objects`, they're primitives.
-   primitive and variable assigned a primitive value are different
-   No methods, no properties: But JS has wrapper around primitives. Eg. `string` primitive has the **ephemeral** `String` object wrapper which gives it nice methods like `includes`. Sometimes called the "auto-boxing behavior"
-   All primitive types, except `null` and `undefined`, have their corresponding `object` wrapper.


#### Non-primitive/objects {#non-primitive-objects}

-   Mutable
-   Definition: `objects` can be seen as a collection of `properties/methods`
-   `object` can have `properties` and `methods`, none, one or both.
-   Most things except primitives are objects. Even functions.


### More on non-primitive/objects {#more-on-non-primitive-objects}


#### FAQ on Object &amp; object {#faq-on-object-and-object}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Using Object as a map

    -   I used to use `Object` as map/dictionary for storing k-v data.
    -   Not good, because it has all the extra property things that we don't care about. It's like taking an airplane to go 2kms. Use `Map` instead.

<!--list-separator-->

-  What about `[object Object]`?

    -   String representation when `toString()` is used.
    -   `Object.prototype.toString()` returns `"[object Type]"`
    -   `Type` is set by `Symbol.toStringTag`
    -   When `Symbol.toStringTag` is unset, it'll just go `[object Object]`


#### `object` vs `Object` {#object-vs-object}

-   `object`
    -   There's nothing tangible called `object` in JS. It's a concept. It's anything that has properties, it's anything that's not a primitive.
    -   Issues w `typeof`
        -   One source of confusion is the `typeof` operator. For anything other than a pre-defined list it'll return "object". This just signals that it's some object, something's that's not a primitive. (`typeof` is like a limited best effort thing)
        -   Eg. `typeof new Date()` and `typeof null` both return 'object'. So for differentiating between subtypes, maybe use `instanceof`
        -   So `typeof` is good if you just want to work on `primitive` values.
-   `Object`
    -   JS has many built in `objects`, `Object` (w the capital `O`) is one of them.
    -   Other common `objects` are Function, Array, Date, RegExp, Error etc.
    -   `Object` behaves the same as `{}` (Object literal)
        ```javascript
        // object literals are cool
        const obj = {
          // __proto__
          __proto__: theProtoObj,
          // Shorthand for 'handler: handler'
          handler,
          // Methods
          toString() {
            // Super calls
            return "d " + super.toString();
          },
          // Computed (dynamic) property names
          ["prop_" + (() => 42)()]: 42,
        };
        ```
    -   Every `object` in JS is inherited of `Object.prototype`


#### Properties {#properties}

-   `property` is an association between a name (or key) and a value. When the value of a `property` is a `function`, we call it a `method`.
-   Can be "assigned", or can be set via `attributes` using `Object.defineProperty`
-   There are hidden/internal properties, usually represented via `[[`. eg. `[[Prototype]]`.
-   JS objects have properties. They're of 2 types.
    -   Data property: value, writable, enumerable, configurable
    -   Accessor property: get, set, enumerable, configurable

<!--list-separator-->

-  Prototype

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221126085225-javascript-1323635811.png" >}}

    -   `prototype` of an `object` is conceptually a hidden `property`
    -   `prototype` of points to another `object` or to `null`
    -   Usually represented using `[[Prototype]]`, sometimes `obj.__proto__` but that's not official.
    -   WATCHOUT: `Functions` (constructors) have a `.prototype` property, that's different. It specifies what the `[[Prototype]]` should be for newly created objects using the constructor.


## Other stuff {#other-stuff}


### Functions {#functions}


#### this {#this}

-   It has 5 perspective, check javascript garden ref. for solid info
-   arrow functions are cool, when using them `this` will point parent(past hack: bind, self etc.), it does not have its own `this`. So ez.


#### apply/call/bind {#apply-call-bind}

-   These help us **explicitly** set `parameters` using `this`
-   The first `parameter` of these functions point to the `thisArg` (what should `this` point to)
-   `call`
    -   Lets us call some function by explicitly setting `this`
    -   Don't need it usually
-   `apply`
    -   like `call` but lets us pass array of arguments
    -   Earlier we needed to do things like `Math.max.apply(null, nums)`, now we don't need it cuz spread operator
    -   Don't need it usually
-   `bind`
    -   Lets us build new functions out of `parameters`
    -   Related to the idea of currying


#### Closures {#closures}

-   A closure is formed by
    -   Returning from a function from the execution context of a function call and referencing that inner function to a property of another object.
    -   Directly assigning a reference to such a function object to, for example, a global variable, a property of a globally accessible object or an object passed by reference as an argument to the outer function call.


### Promises {#promises}

-   Check [the execution order](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function#async_functions_and_execution_order) here
-   Not to mention, these are `objects`
-   `catch(failureCallback)` is short for `then(null, failureCallback)`
-   If your error handling code is the same for all steps, you can attach `catch` it to the end of the chain
-   The handlers we pass to `.then` and `.catch` NEED to `return`. Otherwise we end up creating a race condition.
-   When we do `.then(()=> doSomething())` we mean `.then((IGNORE_RESULT_HERE)=> doSomething())`
-   Good habit to always have a `.catch`
-   `async/await` helps avoid most of the catches here.
-   `Promise.all` runs things concurrently(doesn't check order), We can use `reduce` to [run things sequentially](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#composition). But make sure you want to run things sequentially. In general if simply chaining with `.then`, then things will be invoked in order.


#### Nested or flat? {#nested-or-flat}

<a id="code-snippet--nested vs flat"></a>
```javascript
const listOfIngredients = [];

doSomething()
  .then((url) =>
    fetch(url)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        listOfIngredients.push(data);
      }),
  )
  .then(() => {
    console.log(listOfIngredients);
  });

// OR

doSomething()
  .then((url) => fetch(url))
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    listOfIngredients.push(data);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log(listOfIngredients);
  });
```

-   Simple promise chains are best kept flat without nesting
-   nested chains can be useful if you want to scope `catch` / error silencing, eg. do not make failure of some optional chain fail the whole thing.


#### Mix callbacks and promises? {#mix-callbacks-and-promises}

-   Not a good idea to mix callbacks and promises
-   Better to just convert the callback thing into a promise.
    ```js
    const wait = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
    ```


#### `await` {#await}

-   for loop / for-loop and wait
    -   [javascript - Using async/await with a forEach loop - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37576685/using-async-await-with-a-foreach-loop)
    -   <https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/155t0mu/await_promiseall_and_map_doesnt_work_in_order_of/>
        -   for await of


### Typed Arrays {#typed-arrays}

```js
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // just the buffer
const int32View = new Int32Array(buffer); // we add a view to the buffer
const int16View = new Int16Array(buffer); // we add another view to the same buffer!

// data objects containing multiple data types
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(24);
const idView = new Uint32Array(buffer, 0, 1);
const usernameView = new Uint8Array(buffer, 4, 16);
const amountDueView = new Float32Array(buffer, 20, 1);

```

-   These are very different things technically from `Array`
-   Implementation: `ArrayBuffer` + `view/context`
    ![](/ox-hugo/20221126085225-javascript-2140028271.png)
    -   `ArrayBuffer` : Just chunks of data, no methods nothing. fixed-length binary data buffer.
    -   `view/context/Dataview`: data type, starting offset, and number of elements etc.
-   It's [not accessible directly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray), instead you use the different `views`, examples some predefined `views`.
    ![](/ox-hugo/20221126085225-javascript-1615753563.png)
-   If you need custom view, might look at `Dataview`, it gives you low level access and can change things like change the byte order.


### Random notes {#random-notes}

-   You can also use the unary plus `+` as a shorthand for `Number()`
-   `??` (Nullish coalasing is cool)
-   JS now has `?.` like [Ruby]({{< relref "20221101220205-ruby.md" >}})
-   If you pass any other object to the index signature the JavaScript runtime actually calls .toString on it before getting the result.
