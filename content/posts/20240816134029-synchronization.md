## What? {#what}

-   Robust database-grade syncing technology to ensure that data is consistent and up-to-date.
-   To fully replace client-server APIs, sync engines need:
    -   Robust support for fine-grained `access control`
    -   Complex `write validation`


### Problems and how sync engines helps üåü {#problems-and-how-sync-engines-helps}


#### No Offline Reading {#no-offline-reading}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/SCR-20250415-loem.png" >}}

> Problem: Reads always occur over the network, meaning offline reading isn't possible, and you'll face the latencies.
> Solution: `Stale-While-Revalidate Caching`

-   Caches read operations for fast access
-   Serves stale (cached) data immediately while fetching fresh data in background
-   Solves by:
    -   Reducing read latencies to near-zero for cached data
    -   Enabling offline reads from cache


#### Laggy writes/interactions {#laggy-writes-interactions}

> Problem: Writes, making all interactions feel laggy and without offline support.
> Solution: `Optimistic Updates`

-   Allows immediate local state mutations before server validation
-   Changes appear instantly in the UI while syncing in background
-   Solves by:
    -   Making writes feel instantaneous
    -   Enabling offline write operations

Optimistic Update needs a server synchronization strategy. Primarily 2 types:

-   `Serializable`
    -   Server only accepts operations matching its current state
    -   Rejects operations based on stale data
    -   Simpler model, common in many databases
-   `Commutative`
    -   Operations designed so order doesn't matter
    -   Uses operations like "increment counter" instead of "set counter to X"
    -   Examples: [crdt]({{< relref "20230607045339-crdt.md" >}}) and OT (Operational Transformation) fall under `commutative`


#### Stale data, No real-time {#stale-data-no-real-time}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/SCR-20250415-lmyh.png" >}}

> Problem: The stateless model can‚Äôt offer real-time collaboration, since the server doesn‚Äôt proactively push updates to the client.
> Solution: `server-to-client` communication.

-   Server "pings" changes to clients (eg. [SSE]({{< relref "20230222180430-sse.md" >}}), [WebSockets]({{< relref "20230222181643-websockets.md" >}}), [HTTP]({{< relref "20230222161545-http.md" >}}) streaming etc)
    -   Otherwise the simplest way to replicate data is for client to poll for updates every second or so.
-   Enables multiple users to work together simultaneously
-   Ensures all clients eventually converge to the same state


### Usecases of sync engines {#usecases-of-sync-engines}

> source: <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/8/stop-syncing-everything/>

-   `Offline-first apps`: Note-taking, task management, or CRUD apps that operate partially offline. Graft takes care of syncing, allowing the application to forget the network even exists. When combined with a conflict handler, Graft can also enable multiplayer on top of arbitrary data. See [Local First Software (LoFi)]({{< relref "20230915141853-local_first_software.md" >}})
-   `Cross-platform data`: Eliminate vendor lock-in and allow your users to seamlessly access their data across mobile platforms, devices, and the web. Graft is architected to be embedded anywhere.
-   `Stateless read replicas`: Due to Graft's unique approach to replication, a database replica can be spun up with no local state, retrieve the latest snapshot metadata, and immediately start running queries. No need to download all the data and replay the log.
-   `Replicate anything`: Graft is just focused on consistent page replication. It doesn't care about what's inside those pages. So go crazy! Use Graft to sync AI models, Parquet or Lance files, Geospatial tilesets, or just photos of your cats. The sky's the limit with Graft.

### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Other notes {#other-notes}

-   Clients tend to have unrestricted write access and updates are immediately synced to other clients. While this is generally fine for text collaboration or multiplayer drawing, this wouldn‚Äôt work for a typical ecommerce or SaaS application.
-   Sync engines can drive consistency within a system but real-world systems also need an authoritative server which can enforce consistency within external constraints and systems.

### Comments {#comments}

>
>
> Guy who‚Äôs been working full-time on sync since 2011 here. This is valid as far as it goes, but it‚Äôs all written with the assumption that you have exactly two (2) data stores to keep in sync, and that only one is mutable while the other is a passive replica. That is Easy Mode. It‚Äôs training wheels, it‚Äôs the tutorial level, ya?
>
> What makes sync difficult is when you have more than two databases, and more than one is being mutated. It‚Äôs not just the possibility of conflicts, it‚Äôs that the metadata and algorithms to identify changed data become more complex than just ‚Äúset a flag when you change a record.‚Äù
>
> CouchDB (and Couchbase Mobile, my $DAYJOB) use a combination of sequence numbers and revision trees.
>
> The sequence number is a record field that‚Äôs local to each replica. It‚Äôs a counter that acts as a logical timestamp. By remembering the highest sequence number you‚Äôve seen, you can then cheaply query for all records modified since that time.
> Revision trees are global. Every document/record stores multiple revisions in a causal history. Each revision has an ID based on a digest of the data, making it fairly cheap to tell if both sides of the connection have the same revision. Normally these form a linear history, but conflicts introduce branches, which are later merged by application logic.

> Another good approach is to use Prolly Trees, of which several good articles have been posted here in the past year.

## Resources {#resources}


### Case studies {#case-studies}


#### How does PartyKit do it? {#how-does-partykit-do-it}

> "With a model like PartyKit, building a system that can synchronise state is straightforward: Hold that state in memory, let websockets (or http requests!) connect to the same process. When clients ‚Äúsend‚Äù changes to said state, broadcast those changes to all connected clients. Depending on the usecase, you can use fancier data structures to model the state (like CRDTs or OTs), setup state machines to model workflows, or use a pubsub model to broadcast events."

-   This draws the boundaries nicely about the network aspect, and the managing the state Aspect.
