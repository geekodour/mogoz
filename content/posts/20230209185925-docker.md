Ya allah.


## History {#history}

-   Started out being built on top of `LXC`
-   Later moved beyond `LXC` containers to its own execution environment called `libcontainer`.


## FAQ {#faq}


### How layers create bloat? {#how-layers-create-bloat}

```text
RUN apt-get install foo
RUN foo generate-things
RUN apt-get uninstall foo
```

-   This will effectively still have `foo` in the image. (It's just masking)
-   Layers can add bloat to a docker file. This depends very much on the specifics of what the `RUN` steps are doing and the order of them.
-   Eg. Just changing files will often create a layer with another copy of those files with the different attributes (e.g. chmod). That means you have very similar content in two separate layers which creates bloat.
-   Each "ALLCAPS" directive in a Dockerfile, like RUN, COPY, etc. are "layers" that get cached. So installing deps should be different layer than copying source code.


### What's the solution to layer bloat? {#what-s-the-solution-to-layer-bloat}

-   Deleting before creating the layer prevents them from ever actually being stored. You can do this with [HEREDOC](https://www.docker.com/blog/introduction-to-heredocs-in-dockerfiles/) :)
-   When developing scripts for running inside Docker, to copying of the script as late as possible in the Dockerfile so that the preceding layers can be reused
-   It is possible with build stages/[multi staged builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) and `copy from`, but not super trivial.


### What firewall changes does Docker do? {#what-firewall-changes-does-docker-do}

See [Firewalls]({{< relref "20230306125249-firewalls.md" >}})


### How does docker handle networking {#how-does-docker-handle-networking}

```shell
docker network ls --filter 'driver=bridge' # docker0 is default and is named "bridge"
docker network inspect <net_id>
```


#### IP and ports {#ip-and-ports}

-   Default network range for docker: `172.17.0.0/16` (TODO: Confirm this range, not that it matters for us)
    -   Host: `172.17.0.1` (`docker0` ip)
    -   1st container: `172.17.0.2`, 2nd container: `172.17.0.3` etc.
-   When setting port mapping, you can specify the IP, otherwise might get binded to `0.0.0.0`


#### [iptables]({{< relref "20230309160055-iptables.md" >}}) changes {#iptables--20230309160055-iptables-dot-md--changes}

-   Creates these chains: `DOCKER`, `DOCKER-USER`, `DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE1`, and `DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE2`
    -   `DOCKER` : Rules for docker
    -   `DOCKER-USER` : Custom user rules that'll go before docker's rules.
-   Any changes added to `FORWARD` chain will be evaluated after `DOCKER` and `DOCKER-USER` chains.
-   `docker0` : Rules are used in the `FORWARD` chain for forwarding packets on this interface to the running containers.


### What's dockers image format? {#what-s-dockers-image-format}

It's OCI but [legacy](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25779).Maybe updated recently?


### What about the scratch image? {#what-about-the-scratch-image}

-   It's a very simple thing even simpler than busy box. Doesn't even have a shell.
-   You can attach a shell to it by running another container in its namespace etc. for debugging.


### What's Moby? {#what-s-moby}

-   Umbrella project that develops components used by docker and other container engine. Docker(cli+dockerd) also fall under it.


## Things I keep hearing about {#things-i-keep-hearing-about}

-   run mounts
-   containerd ecosystem
-   overly filesystems like AUFS and overlayfs
-   Linux bridge infrastructure and how Linux routing works.
