## Random notes {#random-notes}


### About layers and bloat {#about-layers-and-bloat}

-   Layers can add bloat to a docker file. This depends very much on the specifics of what the `RUN` steps are doing and the order of them.
-   Eg. Just changing files will often create a layer with another copy of those files with the different attributes (e.g. chmod). That means you have very similar content in two separate layers which creates bloat.
-   Eg. Issue with the design of layers is that you data never gets deleted. i.e Doing something like `RUN apt-get install foo` `RUN foo generate-things` `RUN apt-get uninstall foo` will effectively still have `foo` in the image.
-   This can be contained however (pun intended)
    -   When developing scripts for running inside Docker, to copying of the script as late as possible in the Dockerfile so that the preceding layers can be reused
    -   It is possible with `build stages/multi staged builds` and `copy from`, but not super trivial.


### Docker and firewalls {#docker-and-firewalls}

Hmm See [Firewalls]({{< relref "20230306125249-firewalls.md" >}})


## History {#history}

-   Started out being built on top of `LXC`
-   Later moved beyond `LXC` containers to its own execution environment called `libcontainer`.


## Things I keep hearing about {#things-i-keep-hearing-about}

-   run mounts
-   containerd ecosystem
-   overly filesystems like AUFS and overlayfs
-   Linux bridge infrastructure and how Linux routing works.


## Docker networking {#docker-networking}

```shell
docker network ls --filter 'driver=bridge' # docker0 is default and is named "bridge"
docker network inspect <net_id>
```


### IP and ports {#ip-and-ports}

-   Default network range for docker: `172.17.0.0/16` (TODO: Confirm this range, not that it matters for us)
    -   Host: `172.17.0.1` (`docker0` ip)
    -   1st container: `172.17.0.2`, 2nd container: `172.17.0.3` etc.
-   When setting port mapping, you can specify the IP, otherwise might get binded to `0.0.0.0`


### [iptables]({{< relref "20230309160055-iptables.md" >}}) changes {#iptables--20230309160055-iptables-dot-md--changes}

-   Creates these chains: `DOCKER`, `DOCKER-USER`, `DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE1`, and `DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE2`
    -   `DOCKER` : Rules for docker
    -   `DOCKER-USER` : Custom user rules that'll go before docker's rules.
-   Any changes added to `FORWARD` chain will be evaluated after `DOCKER` and `DOCKER-USER` chains.
-   `docker0` : Rules are used in the `FORWARD` chain for forwarding packets on this interface to the running containers.
