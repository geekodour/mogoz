## Basics {#basics}

There is no such thing as a container, but only as much as containing is a thing you do.


### Implementations {#implementations}


#### Linux containers {#linux-containers}

Modern containers are a mix of cgroups, namespaces, pivot_root (like chroot but more appropriate for containers), and seccomp. But this is just one possible implementation. There are also, certainly, other ways of implementing containers.

-  [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}})

    Docker is a reference implementation for the concept of containers. It provided a simple, practical way to bundle applications and their dependencies in a relatively standardized way. Dockerâ€™s main innovation was the layering system

-  Other linux container solutions

    Some implementations (e.g. firecracker-containerd) also use SELinux and CPU virtualization support.


#### Others {#others}

-   OpenVZ and Solaris Containers (aka zones) both predate the current linux implementation and did not use namespaces or cgroups.
-   BSD Jails
-   One could ship application components as containers, but have them [run as VMs](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/)
-   Dockers for Windows and Macs do not even use "cgroups" and "namespaces" because these technologies are not available on these stacks, it resorts to plain old VMs.
