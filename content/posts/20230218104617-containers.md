## Basics {#basics}

There is no such thing as a container, but only as much as containing is a thing you do.


### Linux containers {#linux-containers}

Modern containers are a mix of cgroups, namespaces, pivot_root (like chroot but more appropriate for containers), and seccomp. But this is just one possible implementation. There are also, certainly, other ways of implementing containers.

-   [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) : Docker is a reference implementation for the concept of containers. It provided a simple, practical way to bundle applications and their dependencies in a relatively standardized way. Docker’s main innovation was the layering system
-   [LXC &amp; LXD]({{< relref "20230223110853-lxc.md" >}})
-   Other linux container solutions: Some implementations (e.g. firecracker-containerd) also use SELinux and CPU virtualization support.


### Containers without namespaces {#containers-without-namespaces}

-   One could ship application components as containers, but have them [run as VMs](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/), eg. [firecracker-containerd](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd)
-   Dockers for Windows and Macs do not even use "cgroups" and "namespaces" because these technologies are not available on these stacks, it resorts to plain old VMs.


### Comparison w Solaris Zones and BSD Jails {#comparison-w-solaris-zones-and-bsd-jails}

-   [Ramblings from Jessie](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/)
-   Solaris Zones, BSD Jails are first class concepts.
-   Containers on the other hand are not real things.
-   "Containers are less isolated than Jails/Zones but allow for a flexibility and control that is not possible with Jails, Zones, or VMs. And THAT IS A FEATURE."
-   Containers are not sandboxing but we can attempt to sandbox it and good attempts have been made. One example is [gvisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor)


## Images {#images}


### What is it? {#what-is-it}

-   a `.tar`
-   We basically bundle the application together w deps and just enough of a Linux root filesystem to run it.
-   Usually updated in version compared to updated in place


### Implementations {#implementations}

-   Using Dockerfile
-   Using nix dockerTools ([NixOS]({{< relref "20231011141721-nixos.md" >}}))


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Concept of `user` during image creation {#concept-of-user-during-image-creation}


#### Use of `USER` {#use-of-user}

-   It's reasonable to build the application as root and switch only to a non-root `USER` at the very end of the Dockerfile using `USER`.
    -   Later at runtime, `USER` can always be overridden by the `--user` cli flag.
-   [docker - Install all packages in root and switch to a non-root user or use \`gosu\` or \`sudo\` directly in a dockerfile? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77090431/install-all-packages-in-root-and-switch-to-a-non-root-user-or-use-gosu-or-sud)
-   While you can just [make up](https://gamlor.info/posts-output/2021-05-04-linux-on-to-fly-users/en/) UIDs when passing `--user`, usually you'd want that user to be actually present inside the container
    -   In those case you'd use `useradd` / `groupapp` like normal linux installation
    -   [the process is split](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/managing-users-and-permissions-in-a-docker-build/14905) into two operations, even with the standard Docker tools, i.e.
        -   first you create the new user so that you can configure the files to be owned by it (`useradd` phase)
        -   and then you have to configure the containers produced by this image to be run as that particular user by default. (`USER` / `gosu` etc.)
        -   You can do it in multi-staged builds (even with nix dockerTools but I don't see it as strictly necessary)


#### Use of `gosu` {#use-of-gosu}

> gosu is only for de-elevating from root to a normal user. It is normally used as the last step of an entrypoint script to run the actual service as a non-root user (ie exec gosu nobody:nobody redis-server). This is useful when you need to do a few setup steps that require root (like chown a volume directory) and yet not have the service running as root. If you do not need any root access before the service starts, then USER nobody:nobody in the Dockerfile (or --user nobody:nobody on docker run) will accomplish the same thing (gosu uses the same function from runc that docker uses).

-   [Gosu and user ? · Issue #55 · tianon/gosu · GitHub](https://github.com/tianon/gosu/issues/55)
-   [dockerfile - Docker using gosu vs USER - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36781372/docker-using-gosu-vs-user)
-   gosu and rootless: <https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6816>
-   My heuristic: reachout for `gosu` only if you need to do priviledged operations in the entrypoint file, otherwise just use `USER`


## Filesystem and storage {#filesystem-and-storage}


### Overlayfs {#overlayfs}

-   Containers usually don't have a persistent root filesystem
-   overlayfs is used to create a temporary layer on top of the container image.
-   This is thrown away when the container is stopped.


### Block devices {#block-devices}

-   Docker and containerd use overlay filesystems instead of loopback devices.
-   CSI might [mount it as loopback](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40869877)


### Mounts {#mounts}

#### Host volumes / `bind mounts` {#host-volumes-bind-mounts}

-   persistent data outside of the container image is grafted on to the container's filesystem via a bind mount to another location on the host.
-   We need to make sure UID/GID inside the container match what's there in the directory/file we're bind mounting etc.


#### Named volumes {#named-volumes}

> -   When you create a volume, it's stored within a directory on the Docker host.
> -   When you mount the volume into a container, this directory is what's mounted into the container.
> -   This is similar to the way that bind mounts work
>     -   Except that volumes are managed by Docker and are isolated from the core functionality of the host machine.

-   Can be assigned a "driver", either `local` or `image`
    -   `local` can further be configured in ways to use normal [Operating Systems]({{< relref "20221101172456-operating_systems.md" >}}) [Mounting related stuff]({{< relref "20221101145053-filesystems.md#mounting-related-stuff" >}})! So in a way we can do bind mounts too with `name:local volume` but idk why you'd want to do that. (using `--opt` option to pass `mount` options etc.)


#### Other volumes {#other-volumes}

-   Host volumes(bind mounts) and Names volumes(managed by docker) are ideas around [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) and [Podman]({{< relref "20230223192104-podman.md" >}}).
-   If you're using some [Orchestrator]({{< relref "20231025103420-queues_and_scheduling.md" >}}), things might be totally different in terms of how volumes are handled.
    -   For eg. [Nomad]({{< relref "20240407004157-nomad.md" >}}) automatically bind mounts its "task directories" into the container while you can configure "nomad volumes" to the container. You could also do podman/docker volume etc. These become specific to the orchestrator at that point.


## Container Security (containers using linux namespaces) {#container-security--containers-using-linux-namespaces}


### Privileged and Unprivileged &amp; Rootless {#privileged-and-unprivileged-and-rootless}


#### on use of the phrase "privileged containers" {#on-use-of-the-phrase-privileged-containers}

I am not against use of this term but for clarity, I like to think it like this:

-   There's no `privileged` or `non/un-privileged` containers. But only containers made to run in a `privileged/non-privileged` manner by combination of various things that can be applied to a running container and it's a spectrum.
-   Following are some of those things which determine if a "running" container is actually privileged.
    -   user [namespaces]({{< relref "20230304175529-linux_namespaces.md" >}}): Whether user namespaces(uid/gid) is even involved. This can be per container or across containers etc (see [userns](https://docs.podman.io/en/v4.4/markdown/options/userns.container.html)) or none.
    -   `rootless/rootfull`: This is just using `user namespace` in an opinionated way with regards to the `root` user and few other runtime specific things.
        -   [Rootless containers using Podman | Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-containers-podman)
    -   [Linux Capabilities]({{< relref "20230304214935-linux_capabilities.md" >}}): Even if you run the container in rootfull mode(eg. no uid mapping whatsoever), if you get use capabilities `root` inside the container would not have as much power as it would normally have, however it'd still be able to edit any files etc. which is still concerning.
    -   `--user` flag : Is "specific to the main command" being run, defaults to `root`, can be overridden by using `USER` in the `Containerfile` or by passing this option during run. This is useful both in `rootfull` and `rootless` modes.
    -   `--priviliged` flag: What this flag does depends on the container engine you're using. But affects the execution of the container as a whole. See [this](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/privileged-flag-container-engines) for more info.

At any given setup multiple of these(or more) things will be at play and will actually determine whether if things are actually "privileged".


#### The `--user` vs rootless mode {#the-user-vs-rootless-mode}

> -   "Rootless mode" is handled differently by [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) and [Podman]({{< relref "20230223192104-podman.md" >}}) (better to assume that the ideas don't transfer directly)
> -   The podman docs give a good description:  [podman-run — Podman documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#user-u-user-group)

-   First of all, for you to specify `--user` the uid to be specified must exist inside the container. You'd using something like `useradd` for that during image creation.
-   This sets the UID to be used `ONLY FOR THE COMMAND following that execution` and overrides `USER` set during image creation.
-   When you use `rootfull` container, eg. default [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}), you can pass in the `--user` flag, this will run the main command as that user but then you can exec into the container and then run command as `root` inside the container which is also `root` outside the container. When running in `rootless` mode, this is not the case, in the exec case, you'll be un-previledged user outside the container even if you're root inside.
-   So since `--user` overrides the user, and rootless more re-maps the uid, do we need `--user` in rootless mode? Yes.
    -   See [Should you use the --user flag in rootless containers? | Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/user-flag-rootless-containers)
    -   Summary: `root` inside the container maps to a valid `uid` in the host, but other `uid` other than `root` map to fake uids which have less capabilities. (See linked post). So using `--user` + `rootless` is safer.

#### [Linux Capabilities]({{< relref "20230304214935-linux_capabilities.md" >}}) in rootless vs rootful {#linux-capabilities--20230304214935-linux-capabilities-dot-md--in-rootless-vs-rootful}

-   Capabilities are per process things but they can be under a "user namespace",
-   When you're using rootfull, capabilities go as `root` (root in container and host are the same)
-   When using rootless, even you give the capabilities you're giving that inside the usernamespace


#### Different meanings of Privileged and Unprivileged &amp; Rootless {#different-meanings-of-privileged-and-unprivileged-and-rootless}

> Unprivileged containers != Rootless containers

> If containers are running as non-root users, when the runtime is still running as root, we don’t call them Rootless Containers.

            > There’s no shared network for rootless containers. Each one is plumbed into a tap interface which is then networked out to the host by slirp4netns. So if you start two containers in rootless mode, by default, they can’t talk directly to each other without exposing ports on the host.
            > All your containers get the same IP address. On the installation I’m using they all get 10.0.2.100
            >
            > By comparison, if you run containers rootfully, the networking looks much more similar to the default Docker configuration. Containers will get an individual IP address, and will be able to communicate with other containers on the bridge network that they’ve been connected to.

### UID/GID and SUID/SGID {#uid-gid-and-suid-sgid}


#### subuid and subgid subordinate(uids/gids) {#subuid-and-subgid-subordinate--uids-gids}

> Different from [setuid and setgid bits]({{< relref "20230223124320-linux_permissions.md#setuid-and-setgid-bits" >}})

-   `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` let you assign extra user ids and group ids to a particular user. The `subuid` file contains a list of users and the user ids that the user is allowed to impersonate.
    -   Any resource owned by user(inside the container) which is not mapped(outside container) will get id `-1` (`nobody`)
    -   Range of ids you assign are no longer available to be assigned to other users (both primary and via `subuid`)
    -   `user` to which they are assigned now 'owns' these ids.
-   Configured via the `subid` field in `/etc/nsswitch.conf` ([nsswitch]({{< relref "20230228000520-nsswitch.md" >}})) file. (Has default set to `files`)
-   See [shadow-utils](https://www.mankier.com/package/shadow-utils)

-  What about `uid_map` and `gid_map` ?

    These are specific to user NS. The `newuidmap` tool can help. `newuidmap` sets `/proc/[pid]/uid_map` based on its command line arguments and the uids allowed.


#### Example usecase {#example-usecase}

> Take an example usecase: "container" needs to run as `root`!

In this case, we can re-map this user(`root` inside container) to a less-privileged user on the Docker host.

-   use `usermod` to "allocate" a range of suid to a `user(on host)`. These uid(s) in the range are all fake!
-   Any `uid` from the range can be used to "impersonate" the `user(host)` inside another `user(inside the container)`
    -   i.e If in any case someone breaks out of the container, the `uid` they'll have is the "fake" id, which has no privileges on the host system at all.
-   After this you somehow map this to the `user namespace` (see [Linux Namespaces]({{< relref "20230304175529-linux_namespaces.md" >}}))
    -   In raw linux, you'd use something like `newidmap` to map `uid_map` and `gid_map`
    -   In [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}), you'd use the `userns-remap` config option(`daemon.json`)
        -   You'd do something like `{"userns-remap": "testuser"}` where `testuser` is the one you ran `usermod` for. If you keep the value as `default`, docker would try to create a user `dockremap` for you. (I dont like that autocreate idea honestly)
        -   After that, container runtime should automatically pick the "fake uid".
        -   See [Isolate containers with a user namespace | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/) for more info
-   THIS `user-ns` IS NOT PER CONTAINER!
    -   Per container `user namespace` is not properly supported yet

#### Creating "unprivileged" containers {#creating-unprivileged-containers}

Unprivileged created by:

-   Taking a set of normal UIDs and GIDs from the host
-   Usually at least `65536` of each (to be POSIX compliant)
-   Then mapping those into the container
-   Implementations mostly expect `/etc/subuid` to contain at least `65536 subuids`.
-   This allows [LXC &amp; LXD]({{< relref "20230223110853-lxc.md" >}}) to do the "shift" in containers because it has a reserved pool of UIDs and GIDs.


#### `bind mounts` and UID {#bind-mounts-and-uid}

-   `bind mounts` (also called host volume in contrast to named volume) don't play well with user namespace mapping etc.
-   Mounts are a very separate topic, podman even uses SELinux for filesystem namespacing etc.
-   But since bind mounts use host filesystem directly, it's likely that there will be permission issues which will need to be handled individually
-   I like to avoid bind mounts whenever possible

## Container networking {#container-networking}


### Overview {#overview}

-   Also see [Docker networking]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md#how-does-docker-handle-networking" >}})
-   net ns can be connected using a Linux Virtual Ethernet Device or `veth pair`
-   From a network architecture point of view, all containers on a given Docker host are sitting on bridge interfaces.
-   Different container managers(docker, podman, lxd etc) provide a number of ways networking can be done with containers.
-   An interesting one is the `bridged networking` approach, which essentially boils down to `3 things`.
    1.  Creating `veth` pair from `host` to `net namespace-X`. Every new container will add new `veth` interface and remove it once container is stopped. Eg. `lxc info <instance_name>` will show the `veth` created for the `instance`
        ![](/ox-hugo/20230218104617-containers-1335318030.png)
    2.  Adding a `bridge` for the `veth` pair to talk through. When you install `docker`, it automatically creates a `docker0` bridge created for containers to communicate. `bridge` is a L2 device, uses ARP.
        ![](/ox-hugo/20230218104617-containers-1762862787.png)
    3.  Adding [iptables]({{< relref "20230309160055-iptables.md" >}}) rules to access outside network

### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Golang Questions {#golang-questions}

-   What user to use gid etc.
-   Which image to use, why not alpine
    -   I recomend agains alpine images. They use muslc, that can be a real troublemaker at times. If you don't need any tooling, then distroless image is great. Otherwise debian-slim ticks everything for me.
    -   You can also use SCRATCH but be aware of things like outgoing HTTPS requests, where you need a local CA certificate list for validating certificates.
        -   We can also do COPY --from=build _etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs_
    -   Distroless
        -   a base image with just ca-certificates, a passwd entry and tzdata, which are a few dependencies the Go runtime might look for at runtime.
        -   So it's pretty nice, rather than using SCRATCH
            -   Eg. <https://github.com/a1comms/gcs-sftp-server/blob/master/Dockerfile>
    -   Q: Why not OS base image in golang applications? what about cgo.
-   Which image tool to use, docker or something else?
-   so if you are using containerization in development and not building inside the container, you are missing out on one of the major advantages of the paradigm.
    -   So we should be building inside the container?
    -   <https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/>
    -   [Building a docker image for a Go programm : golang](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/t7hsps/building_a_docker_image_for_a_go_programm/)
        -   Usually people use multi-stage builds. Use the golang image to build the binary, then copy that binary to the more minimal alpine image.
