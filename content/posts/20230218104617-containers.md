## Basics {#basics}

There is no such thing as a container, but only as much as containing is a thing you do.


### Linux containers {#linux-containers}

Modern containers are a mix of cgroups, namespaces, pivot_root (like chroot but more appropriate for containers), and seccomp. But this is just one possible implementation. There are also, certainly, other ways of implementing containers.

-   [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) : Docker is a reference implementation for the concept of containers. It provided a simple, practical way to bundle applications and their dependencies in a relatively standardized way. Docker’s main innovation was the layering system
-   [LXC &amp; LXD]({{< relref "20230223110853-lxc.md" >}})
-   Other linux container solutions: Some implementations (e.g. firecracker-containerd) also use SELinux and CPU virtualization support.


### Containers without namespaces {#containers-without-namespaces}

-   One could ship application components as containers, but have them [run as VMs](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/), eg. [firecracker-containerd](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd)
-   Dockers for Windows and Macs do not even use "cgroups" and "namespaces" because these technologies are not available on these stacks, it resorts to plain old VMs.


### Comparison w Solaris Zones and BSD Jails {#comparison-w-solaris-zones-and-bsd-jails}

-   [Ramblings from Jessie](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/)
-   Solaris Zones, BSD Jails are first class concepts.
-   Containers on the other hand are not real things.
-   "Containers are less isolated than Jails/Zones but allow for a flexibility and control that is not possible with Jails, Zones, or VMs. And THAT IS A FEATURE."
-   Containers are not sandboxing but we can attempt to sandbox it and good attempts have been made. One example is [gvisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor)


## Images {#images}


### What is it? {#what-is-it}

-   a `.tar`
-   We basically bundle the application together w deps and just enough of a Linux root filesystem to run it.
-   Usually updated in version compared to updated in place


### Implementations {#implementations}


#### Dockerfile {#dockerfile}


#### Nix/Guix {#nix-guix}


## Filesystem and storage {#filesystem-and-storage}


### Overlayfs {#overlayfs}

-   Containers usually don't have a persistent root filesystem
-   overlayfs is used to create a temporary layer on top of the container image.
-   This is thrown away when the container is stopped.


### Bind mounts {#bind-mounts}

-   persistent data outside of the container image is grafted on to the container's filesystem via a bind mount to another location on the host.


## Privileged and Unprivileged {#privileged-and-unprivileged}

Whether the root user in the container is the “real” root user (uid 0 at the kernel level).

<div class="warning small-text">

> Unprivileged containers != Rootless containers
>
> If containers are running as non-root users, when the runtime is still running as root, we don’t call them Rootless Containers.
</div>

Unprivileged created by:

-   Taking a set of normal UIDs and GIDs from the host
-   Usually at least `65536` of each (to be POSIX compliant)
-   Then mapping those into the container
-   Implementations mostly expect `/etc/subuid` to contain at least `65536 subuids`.
-   This allows LXD to do the "shift" in containers because it has a reserved pool of UIDs and GIDs.


### subuid and subgid subordinate(uids/gids) {#subuid-and-subgid-subordinate--uids-gids}

-   `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` let you assign extra user ids and group ids to a particular user. The `subuid` file contains a list of users and the user ids that the user is allowed to impersonate.
    -   Any resource owned by user(inside the container) which is not mapped(outside container) will get id `-1` (`nobody`)
    -   Range of ids you assign are no longer available to be assigned to other users (both primary and via `subuid`)
    -   `user` to which they are assigned now 'owns' these ids.
-   Configured via the `subid` field in `/etc/nsswitch.conf` ([nsswitch]({{< relref "20230228000520-nsswitch.md" >}})) file. (Has default set to `files`)
-   Different from [setuid and setgid bits]({{< relref "20230223124320-linux_permissions.md#setuid-and-setgid-bits" >}})
-   See [shadow-utils](https://www.mankier.com/package/shadow-utils)


#### Manual configuration {#manual-configuration}

```shell
$ cat /etc/subuid
#<user>:base_id:total_nos_of_ids_allowed
user1:100000:65536
$ cat /etc/subgid
user1:100000:65536
```


#### Using `usemod` {#using-usemod}

```shell
usermod --add-subuids 1000000-1000999999 root
usermod --add-sugids 1000000-1000999999 pappu
usermod --add-subuids 1000000-1000999999 --add-sugids 1000000-1000999999 xyzuser
```


#### What about `uid_map` and `gid_map` ? {#what-about-uid-map-and-gid-map}

These are specific to user NS. The `newuidmap` tool can help. `newuidmap` sets `/proc/[pid]/uid_map` based on its command line arguments and the uids allowed.


## Container networking {#container-networking}

-   Also see [Docker networking]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md#how-does-docker-handle-networking" >}})
-   net ns can be connected using a Linux Virtual Ethernet Device or `veth pair`
-   From a network architecture point of view, all containers on a given Docker host are sitting on bridge interfaces.
-   Different container managers(docker, podman, lxd etc) provide a number of ways networking can be done with containers.
-   An interesting one is the `bridged networking` approach, which essentially boils down to `3 things`.
    1.  Creating `veth` pair from `host` to `net namespace-X`. Every new container will add new `veth` interface and remove it once container is stopped. Eg. `lxc info <instance_name>` will show the `veth` created for the `instance`

    2.  Adding a `bridge` for the `veth` pair to talk through. When you install `docker`, it automatically creates a `docker0` bridge created for containers to communicate. `bridge` is a L2 device, uses ARP.
        ![](/ox-hugo/20230218104617-containers-1762862787.png)
    3.  Adding [iptables]({{< relref "20230309160055-iptables.md" >}}) rules to access outside network
