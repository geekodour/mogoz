## FAQ {#faq}


### Recursive procedure vs Recursive process {#recursive-procedure-vs-recursive-process}

<div class="warning small-text">

> Knowing the `procedures` and not knowing the `process` is similar to someone who has learned the rules for how the pieces move in chess but knows nothing of typical openings, tactics, or strategy. - [1.2](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/1_002e2.xhtml#g_t1_002e2_002e1)
</div>


#### Procedure {#procedure}

-   A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational process.


#### Process {#process}

-   Recursive: Needs to maintain the state of the caller while the recursive call is in progress.
-   Iterative: The earlier state can be discarded.


#### Why does this distinction matter? {#why-does-this-distinction-matter}

-   This is commonly used in functional programming, a recursive procedure is used [to do a iterative process](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17254240/sicp-recursive-process-vs-iterative-process-using-a-recursive-procedure-to-gene) in the absence of loops in the language.
-   This came to my mind when I thought of implementing [BFS recursively]({{< relref "20230205172402-algorithms.md" >}}). This is like trying to draw a square circle. It's not a recursive process and yet I wanted to do it recursively, I could probably do it but at the end it'll probably just the procedure that'll be recursive and not the process by the nature of the problem.


### Premitive Recursive Functions {#premitive-recursive-functions}

-   <https://www.nayuki.io/page/primitive-recursive-functions>
-   <https://matklad.github.io/2024/08/01/primitive-recursive-functions.html>


### Stack contains Frames {#stack-contains-frames}

-   Stack
    -   Stack aka call stack. Stack grows downwards. Stack contains frames.
-   Frame
    -   Frame aka Stack frame.
    -   Frame = function arguments + local data + return address
    -   Each call to a function creates a new frame and pushes it into the stack


### JMP vs CALL {#jmp-vs-call}

These are assembly instructions but do not directly related to recursion/tail recursion but good to keep in mind.

-   `JMP` : A transfer of the control to another location and the control does not automatically return to the point from where it is called.
-   `CALL` CALL pushes the current instruction pointer on the stack and then then JMPs to the location


### Recursion and the Stack {#recursion-and-the-stack}

-   Generally, [programming Languages]({{< relref "20221101220306-programming_languages.md" >}}) use the [call stack]({{< relref "20221101213015-garbage_collection.md" >}}) to implement recursion.
-   So if you do \\(n!\\) of a large number, there's solid chances you'll blow off the stack.
-   But if get to program in a language that supports `tail recursion` (essentially iteration), usually you'll get infinite recursion without a stack overflow :)
-   See [Recursive tail calls]({{< relref "20230520194955-tail_calls.md#recursive-tail-calls" >}})


## What? {#what}

-   Function that calls itself until the problem is solved.
-   Involves what is referred to as a "base case.”
    -   A base case is the point in which the problem is solved at.


### Factorial example {#factorial-example}

```text
foo(n):
    if n = 1:
       return 1 // base case
    return n*foo(n-1) // inductive case
```

### When to use? {#when-to-use}

-   When it's too difficult/cumbersome to do iteratively
-   When there's high degree of [branching factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_factor)


## Parts {#parts}

This base and inductive cases are more for understanding, when implementing things usually get mixed more or less.


### Base case {#base-case}

-   Solve the simplest cases in the base case
-   The base case does not have to be just one single condition. It can be multiple conditions.
-   Preferably move checks and validation sort of things to the base case. But this is **not** a rule.


### Inductive case {#inductive-case}

-   Sub parts (all may not be at use)
    -   `pre-operation` : Before you recurse
        -   useful when we want to recurse but also do some comparison of sorts on the result before recursing. Eg. find max in a list
    -   `recurse` : Where you recurse
    -   `post-operation` : After you recurse but before the final return. (i.e there can be early returns elsewhere)
        -   useful when we want to modify the recursed value


## Types {#types}


### Position {#position}


#### Head {#head}

-   Without a `pre-operation`


#### Middle {#middle}

-   w a `pre-operation` and `post-operation`


#### Tail {#tail}

See [Tail Calls]({{< relref "20230520194955-tail_calls.md" >}})


### Number of calls {#number-of-calls}


#### Linear {#linear}

Only a single recursive call in the function


#### Non Linear {#non-linear}

-   AKA Multi/Exponential recursion

<!--list-separator-->

-  General Non-Linear Recursion

    -   &gt;1 recursive calls in the function
    -   Binary recursion is a subset of this w 2 recursive calls

<!--list-separator-->

-  Tree/bifurcating Recursion

    -   Divide the input into parts
    -   Call the recursive function on each part
        ![](/ox-hugo/20230429205506-recursion-1438867224.png)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Nested Recursion

    -   One of the arguments to the recursive function is the recursive function itself


### Function called from {#function-called-from}


#### Direct Recursion {#direct-recursion}

-   Function calling itself


#### Indirect/Mutual Recursion {#indirect-mutual-recursion}

-   Function calling another function calling the initial function
-   Two function calling each other


### Nature {#nature}

This is about where a recursive procedure gets the input and how it processes that input. But this doesn't really matter much. But good to know.


#### Structural {#structural}

-   A recursive call is made on a subset of the `original input data`
-   The term "structural recursion" comes from the fact that these structures (lists, BSTs, etc.) can be defined recursively.
    -   You are "undoing" the operation from which these structures are built out of one another.
    -   Eg. A list is either nothing, or a cell followed by a list.
    -   Eg. A binary tree is either nothing, or a node with two binary trees as children.


#### Generative {#generative}

-   A recursive call is made on data that was `constructed/calculated from the original input` data.
-   w Generative recursion, there's no no guarantee that it terminates.
-   Eg. In `quicksort` we create some auxiliary data structures from the original input.


## Optimizations for recursion {#optimizations-for-recursion}


### Memoization {#memoization}

-   Cache repeated recursive calls


### Tail call optimzation {#tail-call-optimzation}

See [Tail Calls]({{< relref "20230520194955-tail_calls.md" >}})


### Trampolining {#trampolining}

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import TypeVar, Callable, TypeAlias

T = TypeVar("T")
TrampolineFunction: TypeAlias = "Callable[[], T | TrampolineFunction[T]]"

def trampoline(function_or_result: T | TrampolineFunction[T]) -> T:
    if not callable(function_or_result):
        return function_or_result

    while callable(function_or_result):
        function_or_result = function_or_result()

    return function_or_result

def fibonacci(
    n: int, partial_result: int = 0, result: int = 1
) -> int | TrampolineFunction[int]:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return result

    # NOTE: Here we're returning lambda instead of a recursive function
    # NOTE: The outer function, "the trampoline" will handle the result and
    #       decide what to do
    return lambda: fibonacci(n - 1, result, partial_result + result)

assert str(trampoline(fibonacci(10000))).startswith("3364476487")
```

-   Idea is to not make the final continuation call inside the function, but to exit and to return the continuation to a trampoline.
-   That trampoline is simply a loop that invokes the returned continuations.


## Tips from the Internet {#tips-from-the-internet}

-   stop trying to imagine the flow, you’ll just get lost and more confused.
    -   Instead, start with your inductive case
        -   If someone handed you the answer to a smaller problem, how would you get the answer to your problem?
    -   Once you’ve figured that out, switch to the base case
        -   What are the smallest problems that you can solve immediately?
    -   Put the two together and you’re probably 95% of the way there.
-   Understand
    -   The difference between structural and generative recursion
    -   The relationship between structural recursion and induction
        -   Every structurally recursive function is a mirror of an inductive definition.
-   The biggest mistake one can make is writing a recursive function without thinking about the inductively defined data it works on.


### Practice tips {#practice-tips}

-   pick 10-20 string or array functions out of your favorite language's standard library and reimplement them without loops.
