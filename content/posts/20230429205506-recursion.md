## Tips from the internet {#tips-from-the-internet}

-   For me, the way to get better at recursion was to be the T.A. of the functional programming class at university and to have to explain it to dozens of confused students during office hours. My main piece of advice was always: stop trying to imagine the flow, you’ll just get lost and more confused. Instead, start with your inductive case: if someone handed you the answer to a smaller problem, how would you get the answer to your problem? Once you’ve figured that out, switch to the base case: what are the smallest problems that you can solve immediately? Put the two together and you’re probably 95% of the way there.
-   The real way to get better at recursion is to understand the difference between structural and generative recursion, and then understand the relationship between structural recursion and induction.
    -   Every structurally recursive function is a mirror of an inductive definition. The biggest mistake one can make is writing a recursive function without thinking about the inductively defined data it works on.
