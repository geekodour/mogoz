## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> FAQ {#faq}


### IP and TCP/UDP {#ip-and-tcp-udp}

-   IP
    -   Naming scheme
    -   `host-to-host`
-   UDP
    -   `process-to-process`
-   TCP
    -   `process-to-process` over `connections` using `byte streams`


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Stream vs Packet {#stream-vs-packet}

-   TCP/IP is stream-oriented
    -   Segment??
-   UDP is packet-oriented


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Segment vs Packets vs Frames {#segment-vs-packets-vs-frames}

-   TCP sends segments
-   IP sends packets
-   Ethernet sends frames
-   See [tcpip - What's the difference between a TCP segment and a TCP packet? - Super...](https://superuser.com/questions/298087/whats-the-difference-between-a-tcp-segment-and-a-tcp-packet)


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Missing Segments in TCP {#missing-segments-in-tcp}

-   Single segment: (Eg. no more data to send), and that packet s lost, the sender will eventually time out and resend the segment. There's no way for the receiver to know that there was a segment in flight, so it can't tell you that it didn't get it.
-   Multiple segments
    -   One in the middle has been lost
    -   Receiver will send out an ACK for every new segment
        -   ACK: highest octet of the segment that `arrived in sequence`
        -   Eg. Sender transmits `1460 octet segments` with initial seq no. of `1, 1461, 2921, 4380, and 5840`, and the `2921` segment gets lost, it send back `ACK of (2920, 2920, 2920, 2920)`.
        -   First segment skipped because of delatyed ACK (???)
-   So it'll detect duplicate ACKs and retransmit missing segments. `Selective ACK(SACK)` can also help here.

## TCP {#tcp}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101183415-network_programming-1265933912.png" >}}

-   Connection: `4-tuple{s_ip, s_port, d_ip, d_port}`

-   [sockets - Is TCP bidirectional or full-duplex? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28494850/is-tcp-bidirectional-or-full-duplex)
    -   it is bidirectional
    -   it supports full-duplex, duplex is property of phy layer not of tcp


## UDP {#udp}

-   Connected sockets: `4-tuple{s_ip, s_port, d_ip, d_port}`
    -   Mostly used for outgoing flows
-   Unconnected sockets: `2-tuple{bind_ip, bind_port}`
    -   Mostly used for inbound server-side stuff
