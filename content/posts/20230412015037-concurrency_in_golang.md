## Goroutines {#goroutines}

-   Execute tasks independently.


## goroutine-safe ? {#goroutine-safe}

See [Goroutine-safe vs Thread-safe](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/ZA0IK1k6UVk)

-   `goroutine-safe` is not well-established term. While `thread-safe` is, and it means safe for concurrent access.
-   You can freely substitute "thread-safe" with "goroutine-safe" in Go docs, unless documentation very explicitly refers to actual threads
-   See [Threads]({{< relref "20221101173032-threads.md" >}})


## Channels {#channels}

-   We want a `goroutine-safe` FIFO object.
    -   A queue with a lock will suffice that requirement
    -   That's exactly what channels are.
-   We use channels for communication &amp; synchronization among goroutines
-   Defined by the `hchan` struct, at runtime this is allocated on the `heap`.
    -   So we essentially get a `pointer` to the `channel`


### Buffered (Asynchronous) {#buffered--asynchronous}

```go
ch := make(chan int, 3)
```

-   Don't use buffer channels unless you're sure you need to


#### Memory safety {#memory-safety}

-   See [Thread Safety]({{< relref "20221101173032-threads.md#thread-safety" >}})
-   Enqueue and Dequeue are "memory copy". This gives us memory safety. Because, no shared memory except the `hchan` and `hchan` is protected by its lock.

### Unbuffered (Synchronous) {#unbuffered--synchronous}

```go
ch := make(chan int)
```

### Other {#other}

-   Q: How channel blocks/unblocks goroutines
-   What is this: `ch := make(chan int, 0)`
-   Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
-   What good for?
    -   Process an endless stream of things
    -   Easily serve multiple goroutines
    -   Receive a notification of something at some point in the future
-   Channel Tips
    -   Always close channels from sending side.
    -   Good to pass a channel as a parameter. (You have control over the channel)


## Shared state?? {#shared-state}

-   Using locks
