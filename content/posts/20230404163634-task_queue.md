## What? {#what}

A queue of tasks


## Distributed Task Queue {#distributed-task-queue}


### Celery {#celery}

-   Celery is a distributed task queue
-   It dispatches tasks/jobs to others servers and gets result back
-   It handles the task part of it but for the "distributed" part, it needs a [Message Queue (MQ)]({{< relref "20230404153903-message_passing.md#message-queue--mq" >}})
-   Needs a `broker` (Message Transports) and a `backend` (Result Store). RabbitMQ (as the broker) and Redis (as the backend) are very commonly used together. Can also be used in other combinations.
