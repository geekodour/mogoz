## How it helps? {#how-it-helps}


### Modular {#modular}

-   Writing two backends for two different architectures would be a lot of work and then lots of platform specific optimizations therefore llvm is the present and seems to be the future for the foreseeable future as well.
-   LLVM is modular in the sense that it never compiles one language straight to machine code.
    -   It has a front-end compiler that compiles your code to an IR.
    -   This IR is called LLVM, as the IR is modeled around a Low-level Virtual Machine(LLVM).
    -   It has a back-end compiler that takes care of translating the IR to the hostâ€™s machine code
-   [WebAssembly]({{< relref "20230510200213-webassembly.md" >}}) is just another backend for LLVM
