## Interrupt What? {#interrupt-what}

-   Interrupt might sound like something bad/annoying
-   When you type, your keyboard is sending interrupts to the cpu; It's something that needs immediate attention.

<!--listend-->

```shell
cat /proc/interrupts
irqtop
```


### How an interrupt happens {#how-an-interrupt-happens}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101173720-interrupts-1872074704.png" >}}

-   Device raises an interrupt on the corresponding IRQ pin
-   `PIC` raises an interrupt on CPU `INTR` pin
    -   PIC waits for CPU to acknowledge before issuing new stuff
-   If the interrupt is accept by the CPU
    -   The processor suspends its current activities
    -   Saves its state
    -   Looks up an `ISR` entry for that specific interrupt from Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
    -   Executes a function called an `ISR` / interrupt handler.


### Interrupt controller {#interrupt-controller}

IRQs need a Interrupt controller, maintains the index of IRQs.

-   Previously Programmable interrupt controller ([PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_interrupt_controller))
    ![](/ox-hugo/20221101173720-interrupts-2041595445.png)
-   now [APIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller)

### Interrupt handler/ Interrupt service routine/ `ISR` {#interrupt-handler-interrupt-service-routine-isr}

-   Interrupt handlers are expected to set interrupt flags
-   This is provided by OS
-   In Linux this is done in 3 phases: critical, immediate and deferred.

#### Interrupt Context {#interrupt-context}

-   Interrupt Context = `ISR` return time - `ISR` start time (That time window)
-   Code is said to be running in Interrupt Context.
-   **NO WAY TO DO CONTEXT SWITCH** (no sleep, user memory access etc)
-   To keep the interrupt context short, it allows to have defered actions.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Tasklets (Defer Action)

    -   Runs in interrupt context
    -   Dynamically allocated
    -   For most purposes, tasklets are much easier to write cuz no need to be reentrant.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Soft IRQs (Defer Action)

    -   Runs in interrupt context
    -   Statically allocated
    -   Run concurrently on several CPUs, even if they are of the same type.
    -   Reentrant functions, and must protect stuff with `spin locks`.

    <!--listend-->

    ```nil
    $ irqtop -S
    HI       high priority tasklet softirq
    SCHED    schedule softirq
    TIMER    timer softirq
    RCU      RCU softirq
    NET_RX   network receive softirq
    BLOCK    block device softirq
    TASKLET  normal priority tasklet softirq
    HRTIMER  high resolution timer softirq
    NET_TX   network transmit softirq
    IRQ_POLL IO poll softirq
    ```

<!--list-separator-->

-  Workqueues (Defer Action)

    -   Deferred work that runs in `process context`
    -   Implemented on top of kernel threads.


### Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) {#interrupt-descriptor-table--idt}

-   Used as a jump table by the CPU when a given vector is triggered
-   May reside anywhere in physical memory
-   It stores pointers to `ISR` that will be automatically invoked by CPU on interrupt receive.


## Interrupt request/ `IRQ` {#interrupt-request-irq}

Processors can enable/disable IRQs by setting interrupt masks. Certain IRQs that cannot be disabled.


### Hardware interrupts (async / external execution/ HW to CPU) {#hardware-interrupts--async-external-execution-hw-to-cpu}

-   hw [interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt) request is an electronic signal from hw device external to the processor
    -   Communicate that the device needs attention from the operating system (OS).
    -   Each device is associated with a particular IRQ signal.


### Exception interrupts (sync / internal execution/ CPU to Kernel) {#exception-interrupts--sync-internal-execution-cpu-to-kernel}

Generated internally by the CPU and used to alert the running kernel of an event or situation which requires its attention.


#### Faults (Recoverable) {#faults--recoverable}

-   This is reported before the execution of the instruction
-   So can be usually corrected.
-   Eg. Page Fault


#### Traps (Recoverable) {#traps--recoverable}

-   Reported after the instruction executed in which exception was detected
-   Eg. debug trap, integer overflow


#### Aborts (Non Recoverable) {#aborts--non-recoverable}

-   Imprecise exceptions.
-   Double fault, second fault while handling first
-   Typically do not allow reliable program restart.
