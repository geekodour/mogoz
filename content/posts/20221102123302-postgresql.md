## Relevant Notes {#relevant-notes}

-   **Initializing a postgres directory:** After logging into the `postgres` user, you can create a directory with necessary postgres files with the `initdb` command. It creates a directory in the file system and then you can start a postgres server directing it to that directory.
-   **Tablespaces:** All tables are by default created in `pg_default` tablespace, creating in a tablespace does not affect the logical SQL schema.
-   **public schema:** All databases will have a public schema created by the `postgres` user. By default `\d` will be showing relations from the public schema.
