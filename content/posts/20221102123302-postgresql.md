## EXPLAIN {#explain}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221102123302-postgresql-1354143187.png" >}}


## Features {#features}


### Temporary Tables {#temporary-tables}

-   Implemented like regular tables
-   Unlike regular tables, not guaranteed to be used by multiple connections at the same time, are not subject to locks, do not require write reliability, etc.
-   located in PostgreSQL system tables. In addition, for each table, one or more files are created on disk (by default, in the same folder as the files for regular tables).


#### Issues {#issues}

-   Need to be purged
    -   `DELETE ALL` bad cuz MVCC (See [Concurrency]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}}))
    -   Deleting is slow because of that
    -   So we `TRUNCATE`
        -   `TRUNCATE` simply creates a new file on disk and does an UPDATE of the `pg_class` table.

### UPSERT {#upsert}

```sql
-- canonical
INSERT INTO table (col1, col2, col3)
VALUES (val1, val2, val3)
ON
 CONFLICT conflict_target conflict_action;
-- example
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, email)
VALUES (2, ‘Dennis’, ‘dennisp@weyland.corp’)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE;
-- conflict_target: (id)
-- conflict_action: DO UPDATE
```


## Relevant Notes {#relevant-notes}

-   **Initializing a postgres directory:** After logging into the `postgres` user, you can create a directory with necessary postgres files with the `initdb` command. It creates a directory in the file system and then you can start a postgres server directing it to that directory.
-   **Tablespaces:** All tables are by default created in `pg_default` tablespace, creating in a tablespace does not affect the logical SQL schema.
-   **public schema:** All databases will have a public schema created by the `postgres` user. By default `\d` will be showing relations from the public schema.
-   In PostgreSQL, the Transaction Id is a 32-bit integer, and the VACUUM process is responsible (among other things like reclaiming old row versions that are no longer in use) for making sure that the id does not overflow.
    -   For this reason, you should never disable the VACUUM as transaction wraparound can lean to catastrophic situations.

Some PostgreSQL footguns:

-   default configuration
-   long transactions mixed with OLTP workload
-   repmgr (and other HA tools not based on consensus algorithms)
-   LISTEN/NOTIFY
-   "pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database" says the official doc
-   moving/copying PGDATA and ignoring glibc version change
-   hot_standby_feedback on/off dilemma
-   partitioning of tables having high number of indexes and receiving QPS &gt;&gt; 1k
-   "setting statement_timeout in postgresql.conf is not recommended because it would affect all sessions" says the official doc
-   using replication slots w/o setting max_slot_wal_keep_size
-   relying only on statement_timeout &amp; idle_in_transaction_session_timeout and thinking it's enough (lack of transaction_timeout)
-   data types "money", "enum", "timestamp" (3 different cases)
-   int4 PK
-   massive DELETE
-   attempts to use transactional version of DDL (e.g., CREATE INDEX) under heavy loads
-   subtransactions
-   DDL under load without lock_timeout
