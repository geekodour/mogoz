## /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow {#etc-passwd-and-etc-shadow}

-   `passwd` is the file where the user information (like username, user ID, group ID, location of home directory, login shell, ...) is stored when a new user is created.
    -   Putting the actual password hash in it was, in hindsight, a mistake; this was corrected pretty quickly with `/etc/shadow` but the file had to stick around with the same name because of all the things that were reading it already.
-   `shadow` is the file where important information (like an encrypted form of the password of a user, the day the password expires, whether or not the passwd has to be changed, the minimum and maximum time between password changes, ...) is stored when a new user is created.
