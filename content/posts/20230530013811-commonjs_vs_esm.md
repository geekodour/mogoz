## The difference {#the-difference}


### ESM {#esm}

-   is a web standard
-   ESM can consume and use CommonJS modules
-   [node ecosystem as of 2023 has not properly moved to esm](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/yp8utv/using_typemodule_is_the_box_of_pandorra/), so better to stick w commonjs w node
-   ESM is made better use of via bundlers for the web. So for web, esm is fine, for node, not so good.
-   `import` is an asynchronous (esm)


### CommonJS {#commonjs}

-   Not a web standard
-   CommonJS cannot consume ESM modules easily, it needs extra loader/transpiler or using [dynamic imports](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#import-expressions)
-   Using dynamic import means you need to deal w promises and put things in IIFE
-   `require` is synchronous (commonjs)


### Modules {#modules}

-   modules on the other hand can be only commonjs, or only esm or both. So we need to be aware of that aswell.
-   eg. jest does don't work otb on esm or something like that


### More brain fry w ts {#more-brain-fry-w-ts}

-   When writing typescript, you can write something that looks like ESM with import/export, while targeting CJS
