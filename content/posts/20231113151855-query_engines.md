## Dump {#dump}

-   DataFusion is another query engine on top of arrow. They both use arrow as lower level memory layout, but both have a different implementation of their query engine and their API. I would say that DataFusion is more focused on a Query Engine and Polars is more focused an a DataFrame lib, but this is subjective.
