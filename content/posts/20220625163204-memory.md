## Cognitive process {#cognitive-process}

-   LTM (parmanent memory)
    -   Without revisit, you'll can forget stuff in ~10h
    -   Stuff u can do without thinking
    -   Facts
-   STM (gather information, 30s, 2-6 items)
-   Working memory (thinking)
    -   Measured by cognitive load


### Cognitive Load (Lower better) {#cognitive-load--lower-better}

-   intrinsic load: how complex the problem is itself
-   extraneous load: what outside distractions add to the problem
-   germane load: the effort required to store information to the LTM ðŸŒŸ
    -   If you're maxed in intrinsic and extraneous load, you won't be able to store stuff to LTM!
    -   Writing can help keeping the intrinsic and extraneous load low here
        -   notes/comments
        -   what are you looking for? what have you found? where will you search next?
        -   decisions
