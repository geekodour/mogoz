## Core Web Vitals {#core-web-vitals}

Core Web Vitals is a subset of Web Vitals(3 metrics)

-   Loading: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
    -   LCP measures the time it takes to get the largest element on the page visible within the viewport.
-   Interactivity: First Input Delay (FID)
    -   It is the perception of an end user’s experience while interacting with a web page.
    -   FID requires real user data and cannot be measured in the lab (e.g. Google Lighthouse).
    -   the `Total Blocking Time (TBT)` metric is lab-measurable and captures issues that affect interactivity.
-   Visual stability: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
    -   CLS is a measure of your site’s overall layout stability.
    -   CLS occurs when elements have been shifted after initially being rendered by the DOM.


## Other metrics {#other-metrics}

-   First Contentful Paint (FCP): Measures the time from when the page begins to load to when the first element is rendered on screen.
