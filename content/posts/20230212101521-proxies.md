## Transparent proxies {#transparent-proxies}

-   A transparent proxy is one that you don't need to manually configure your browser to use. It could be anything that's inline with your internet path will transparently intercept your traffic and proceed to proxy it. This could be your router, firewall, maybe even your ISP. I am not sure how they work with HTTPS, they'll need to be combined with SSL proxy of some kind.
-   When operating on the application level, the problem is that many applications many not honor the proxy settings. A solution to these things is possibly to use transparent proxy which does not need any configuration on application side.
