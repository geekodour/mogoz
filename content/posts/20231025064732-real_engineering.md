This differs from [General Programming]({{< relref "20230122140847-general_programming.md" >}}) / Software Engineering in a sense of what prof. hillelwayne expresses here: [Are We Really Engineers?](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/are-we-really-engineers/)

Following are some topics that are not something I come acrosss as a gene swe but are more popular in other domains of engineering.


## Kalman Filters {#kalman-filters}

    -   To truly understand the Kalman Filter, you need to study Least Squares (aka linear regression), then recursive Least Squares, then the Information Filter (which is a different formulation of the KF). Then you'll realize the KF is just recursive Least Squares reformulated in a way to prioritize efficiency in the update step.
