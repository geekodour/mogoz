## Usecases {#usecases}

-   Allocate `anon` memory (`malloc` uses it internally)
-   Create efficient read and write of files vs `read()` and `write()`
-   Glue some resource(portion of a file) to VAS of some process.
-   Multiple processes can each map the same resource into their memory space
-   IPC (`MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS`)
-   More control on permission
-   Eliminates the protection domain crossing from system calls and
    -   kernel/userspace data copies that I/O system calls such as read() imply. ( See [Disk I/O]({{< relref "20230402013722-disk_i_o.md" >}}) )


## Issues w using it in Databases {#issues-w-using-it-in-databases}

### Transactional Safety {#transactional-safety}

-   OS can flush dirty pages at any time (even if the writing transaction hasn't commited!)
-   Best case scenario can be read-only
-   Solution: OS CoW, Shadow paging


### I/O Stalls {#i-o-stalls}

-   Because with `mmap`, the OS manages your file I/O, you have no idea if your page is in memory or disk
-   Reading from disk can cause I/O stalls


### Error Handing {#error-handing}

-   We want to validate checksum of a `page` when it's loaded to memory
-   We want to check for corruption before writing things back to disk
-   We cannot do these because we don't have the access to that level when I/O is handled by the OS
-   Trying to access mmap data can cause `SIGBUS`
-   Solution: Instead of having all these error handling in the `buffer pool` module, now all this error handling can be seen in rest of your codebase


### Performance Issues {#performance-issues}


## Random notes {#random-notes}


### Precautionary Tales {#precautionary-tales}

-   Use memory maps if you access data randomly, sparse reads.
-   `read` files normally if you access data sequentially.


### Interesting flags {#interesting-flags}

-   `MAP_SHARED` (Share w other processes)
-   `MAP_PRIVATE` (Uses [Copy on Write]({{< relref "20230405020429-copy_on_write.md" >}}))
-   `MAP_ANONYMOUS`
