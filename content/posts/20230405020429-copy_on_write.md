## Copy on Write {#copy-on-write}

-   It's essentially a programming technique which is applicable in many contexts.
-   Filesystems
    -   CoW as an alternative way to do journaling (brtfs uses CoW vs journaling in ext4)
    -   You work on a copy. After you are done, the copy is then made the real file.
-   Memory Management
    -   When new process is created, it'll just point the PTE to the resource, only when it's written to it'll make a copy of it to an actual physical address. See [mmap]({{< relref "20230405022848-mmap.md" >}}).


## Zero Copy {#zero-copy}

-   **This is different from CoW** , but I decided to put them in the same page anyway.
-   zero-copy makes use of direct memory access (DMA)
-   Linux kernel supports few [syscalls]({{< relref "20230330194208-syscalls.md" >}}) with zero copy. Eg. `sendfile` (wrapper around `splice`)
