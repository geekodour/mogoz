## Copy on Write {#copy-on-write}

-   It's essentially a programming technique which is applicable in many contexts.
-   Filesystems
    -   CoW as an alternative way to do journaling (brtfs uses CoW vs journaling in ext4)
    -   You work on a copy. After you are done, the copy is then made the real file.
-   Memory Management
    -   When new process is created, it'll just point the PTE to the resource, only when it's written to it'll make a copy of it to an actual physical address. See [mmap]({{< relref "20230405022848-mmap.md" >}}).


## Zero Copy {#zero-copy}

-   **This is different from CoW** , but I decided to put them in the same page anyway.


### The case of sendfile {#the-case-of-sendfile}

-   Linux kernel supports few [syscalls]({{< relref "20230330194208-syscalls.md" >}}) with zero copy. Eg. `sendfile` (wrapper around `splice`)
-   It avoids kernel-userspace-kernel roundtrip.
-   `sendfile` [is synchronous](https://lwn.net/Articles/810482/) but can be async with [io_uring]({{< relref "20230516155822-io_uring.md" >}}) when `splice` support is added.
    -   w `sendfile` the file content is still buffered, but in Kernel space using [mmap]({{< relref "20230405022848-mmap.md" >}})
    -   `sendfile` doesn't not use [DMA]({{< relref "20230517205323-dma.md" >}}) directly but there can be DMA happeneing in the leaf
        -   DEVICE_TO_MEMORY
            -   DMA copy from disk drive to fd_in buffer
        -   WHAT SENDFILE DOES
            -   fd_in buffer passes the page reference to fd_out buffer via the pipe
        -   MEMORY_TO_DEVICE
            -   Ethernet card went directly to the fd_in buffer for the actual data by looking at the references in the fd_out buffer.
