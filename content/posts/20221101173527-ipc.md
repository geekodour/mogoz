We can make two processes communicate with each other using IPC.


## Shared memory (Indirect) {#shared-memory--indirect}

See [3.7. Shared Memory — Computer Systems Fundamentals](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/OpenCSF/Books/csf/html/ShMem.html)

> As a minor point of terminology, all forms of POSIX IPC, including shared memory, are referred to as objects. In contrast, System V shared memory is called a “segment” for historical purposes.

> NOTE: The need to avoid `pointers` in shared memory
>
> -   shared memory regions cannot use pointers to refer to other parts of the region. For instance, assume the shared memory contains a linked list with the first node at the beginning of the region. The next node appears 256 bytes later. Using the addresses above, in one process, 0x40000000 must contain a pointer to address 0x40000100; in the other address, the pointer must point to 0x50008100, given the different base address.
> -   Instead of using `pointers` use `pointer arithmetic` and make use of offset count from base addr in the two processes.

-   One process creates an area in memory for others to access
-   Fast, `no syscalls` needed but does need some kind of synchronization([Concurrency]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}})).
    -   For applications that exchange large amounts of data, shared memory is far superior to message-passing techniques like message queues, which require system calls for every data exchange.


### POSIX based {#posix-based}


#### `shm_open` {#shm-open}

-   `shm_open()` creates the object but does not specify a size
-   `ftruncate()` resizes the object to be large enough to store one instance of the struct permission.
-   now the [processes]({{< relref "20221101172944-processes.md" >}}) maps the shared memory object into memory with [mmap]({{< relref "20230405022848-mmap.md" >}}), making it a shared region.
    -   Because the [file descriptor]({{< relref "20230315164241-file_descriptors.md" >}}) returned by `shm_open` is in-memory, this `mmap` doesn't create a file backed memory object as hence is safe to be used in a database environment. ([PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) uses it for dynamic shared memory)
    -   After we `mmap`, we no longer need to refer to the shared memory region using [File Descriptors]({{< relref "20230315164241-file_descriptors.md" >}}), we can use useful structs to map the mmaped data to.


#### `shm_unlink` {#shm-unlink}

-   One could say since we use [mmap]({{< relref "20230405022848-mmap.md" >}}) anyway, why do we even need to use `shm_open`?
    -   `shm_open` has useful flags which help in deciding what we want to do with the shared region(permissions etc)
-   Using `shm_unlink()` provides a safety check that is not guaranteed with creating and mapping arbitrary files. Specifically, `shm_unlink()` will not delete the object immediately if any other process also has an open connection (nice!)

## Message Passing (Direct) {#message-passing--direct}

-   Shared memory created in Kernel
-   syscalls such as `send`, `recieve` etc are involved.
-   Pipes make use of message passing. (unidirectional)
-   See [Message Passing]({{< relref "20230404153903-message_passing.md" >}})


## Signals {#signals}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101173527-ipc-1971607797.png" >}}

-   Asynchronous, unidirectional communication between processes.
-   Process receives a signal
    -   Processes the signal immediately
    -   Without finishing the currently running instruction
-   We can list all signals in the system with `kill -l` and `man 7 signal`


### Relationship w Interrupts {#relationship-w-interrupts}

-   The kernel may pass an [interrupt]({{< relref "20221101173720-interrupts.md" >}}) as a signal to processes


### Signal Handlers {#signal-handlers}

-   Signal handler executes in userspace.


### Traps {#traps}

-   So signals are things that one process can send to another
-   Steps
    -   A sends signal to B via a syscall
    -   Kernel intercepts the signal, checks if A can send the signal to B or no and goes on or drops based on that.
    -   If signal is SIGSTOP/SIGKILL it'll send the signal regardless if B is blocking or not.
    -   Kernel sends the signal to B if B is not blocking the signal.
        -   Kernel sets a trap on the thread(B); adds it to the "pending signal set"
        -   Next time the thread(B) is scheduled to run, B handles the signal instead of processing itself.
        -   This means, if the context switch of B never happens, signal never will get processed.
    -   When handing the signal, B has few options
        -   Ignore the signal
        -   Let the defult thing happen
        -   Use a signal handler
