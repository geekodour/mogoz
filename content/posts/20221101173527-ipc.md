We can make two processes communicate with each other using IPC.


## Shared memory (Indirect) {#shared-memory--indirect}

-   One process creates an area in memory for others to access
-   Fast, no syscalls but does need some kind of synchronization.


## Message Passing (Direct) {#message-passing--direct}

-   Shared memory created in Kernel
-   syscalls such as `send`, `recieve` etc are involved.
-   Pipes make use of message passing.
-   See [Message Passing]({{< relref "20230404153903-message_passing.md" >}})


## Signals {#signals}

-   Asynchronous, unidirectional communication between processes.
-   Process receives a signal
    -   Processes the signal immediately
    -   Without finishing the currently running instruction
