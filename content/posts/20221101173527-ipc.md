We can make two processes communicate with each other using IPC.


## Shared memory {#shared-memory}

One process creates an area in RAM which the other process can access, it's fast and no sys calls are involved but it does need some kind of synchronization.


## Message Passing {#message-passing}

Shared memory created in Kernel, sys calls such as `send`,=recieve= etc are involved. Pipes make use of message passing.


## Signals {#signals}

Signals are asynchronous, unidirectional communication between processes. When a process receives a signal, it processes the signal immediately, without finishing the current function or even the current line of code.
