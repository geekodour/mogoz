We can make two processes communicate with each other using IPC.


## Shared memory (Indirect) {#shared-memory--indirect}

-   One process creates an area in memory for others to access
-   Fast, no syscalls but does need some kind of synchronization.


## Message Passing (Direct) {#message-passing--direct}

-   Shared memory created in Kernel
-   syscalls such as `send`, `recieve` etc are involved.
-   Pipes make use of message passing. (unidirectional)
-   See [Message Passing]({{< relref "20230404153903-message_passing.md" >}})


## Signals {#signals}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101173527-ipc-1971607797.png" >}}

-   Asynchronous, unidirectional communication between processes.
-   Process receives a signal
    -   Processes the signal immediately
    -   Without finishing the currently running instruction
-   We can list all signals in the system with `kill -l` and `man 7 signal`


### Relationship w Interrupts {#relationship-w-interrupts}

-   The kernel may pass an [interrupt]({{< relref "20221101173720-interrupts.md" >}}) as a signal to processes


### Signal Handlers {#signal-handlers}

-   Signal handler executes in userspace.


### Traps {#traps}

-   So signals are things that one process can send to another
-   Steps
    -   A sends signal to B via a syscall
    -   Kernel intercepts the signal, checks if A can send the signal to B or no and goes on or drops based on that.
    -   If signal is SIGSTOP/SIGKILL it'll send the signal regardless if B is blocking or not.
    -   Kernel sends the signal to B if B is not blocking the signal.
        -   Kernel sets a trap on the thread(B); adds it to the "pending signal set"
        -   Next time the thread(B) is scheduled to run, B handles the signal instead of processing itself.
        -   This means, if the context switch of B never happens, signal never will get processed.
    -   When handing the signal, B has few options
        -   Ignore the signal
        -   Let the defult thing happen
        -   Use a signal handler
