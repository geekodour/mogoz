## Kernel and Userland {#kernel-and-userland}


### Entry points into the kernel {#entry-points-into-the-kernel}

-   syscalls
-   exceptions
-   traps


### Notifications from kernel to userland process {#notifications-from-kernel-to-userland-process}

-   Error codes from syscalls
-   Signals: software interrupts sent by the kernel to a specific process to notify it of an event.
-   [File Descriptors]({{< relref "20230315164241-file_descriptors.md" >}}): Using something like `eventfd` and then using `poll/select/epoll`
-   FS based notification: Eg. inotify


## Directory {#directory}


### Memory {#memory}


#### brk/sbrk {#brk-sbrk}

We have a syscall to do this, `brk` and `sbrk` (wrapper around `brk` that allows a increment rather than direct address unlike `brk`), when we are using `brk` it gives us new memory based on the page size(see obj header diagram above)


#### mmap {#mmap}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230330194208-syscalls-509177890.png" >}}

-   See [mmap]({{< relref "20230405022848-mmap.md" >}})


#### mlock {#mlock}

-   When `mlock` is set, it won't flush that portion into swap.
-   [Misunderstanding mlock(2) and mlockall(2)](https://eklitzke.org/mlock-and-mlockall)

<!--list-separator-->

-  What it for?

    -   programs that need to store passwords or sensitive decrypted data in memory (See [Vault and mlock() – HashiCorp Help Center](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012787688-Vault-and-mlock-))
    -   programs that need to operate in a real-time environment

<!--list-separator-->

-  What it not for but used for

    -   Increasing performance by letting things not go to swap. In these cases you might aswell just disable swap for that program([cgroups]({{< relref "20230304201630-cgroups.md" >}})) rather than setting mlock.
    -   Some systems still [will swap even if you set mlock](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58092)


### io {#io}


#### ioctl {#ioctl}

-   When an application interacts with a driver, it can use `read`, `write` but it can also use `ioctl` to send specific stuff.


### Process {#process}


#### clone {#clone}

-   `clone` allows you to explicitly specify which parts of the new process are copied into the new process, and which parts are shared between the two processes.
-   Using certain flags, we can either create `threads` or `processes` using `clone()`
-   `thread` : Everything is copied except memory. (Memory is shared). See [Threads]({{< relref "20221101173032-threads.md" >}}) and [Thread Safety]({{< relref "20221101173032-threads.md#thread-safety" >}})


#### fork {#fork}

-   A call to `fork()` is equivalent to a call to `clone(2)` specifying certain flags. (`CLONE_VM`)
-   It creates a copy of itself
-   It creates a child `process` whose page table is a clone of the parent using CoW. i.e Memory is copied, not shared.


#### exec {#exec}

-   When we `fork()`, page table is copied to the child w [Copy on Write]({{< relref "20230405020429-copy_on_write.md" >}}) semantics.
-   When we `exec()`, it blanks the process's current page table, discarding all existing mappings, and replaces them with a fresh page table containing a small number of new mappings
    -   An executable `mmap()` of the new file passed to the `exec()` call.
    -   env vars and command line arguments, same pid, a new process stack, and so on.
-   That's why to launch a new process in Unix-like systems, we do `fork()`, followed immediately by a call to `exec()` (`execve()`)


### Advice {#advice}

These are only acting advisory. The kernel is not obligated to follow them.


#### fadvice {#fadvice}

-   provide hints to the operating system about the application's file access patterns.
-   Sequential, Random, will need etc.


#### madvice {#madvice}

-   provide hints to the operating system about the usage pattern of memory mapped by a process.
-   Sequential, Random, will need etc.
