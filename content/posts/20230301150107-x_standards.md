## Background {#background}

-   The X standards are for "Data communication over the telephone network" (Eg. X-500, X-509)
-   These protocols are typically defined piecemeal throughout multiple specifications and ASN.1 modules. (See [Custom Protocols]({{< relref "20230221012237-custom_protocols.md" >}}))
-   There are other standards from ITU-T: [ITU-T Recommendations](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC/en) (Eg. H265 is part of this)
-   Back in the day, `X.500` (and `X.400`) got a lot of pushback in the IETF crowd because of the use of `ASN.1`, while all IETF protocols of the era were still plaintext.


## X.500 {#x-dot-500}

-   X.500 is a commonly used name for a series of joint `ISO/IEC` and `ITU-T` standards specifying a distributed directory service.
-   First approved in 1988
-   It contains `X.511, X.518, X.525, X.501, X.509, X.510`


## X.509 {#x-dot-509}

-   X.509v3
-   X.509 was designed to be the secure access method for updating `X.500` before the `WWW`
-   `X.500` offers a way to view which organization claims a specific root certificate
-   For browsers, trusted root certificates for supported certificate authorities were pre loaded into certificate storage areas on the personal computer or device.
