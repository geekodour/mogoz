## FAQ {#faq}


### What do we talk about when talking about containers in practice {#what-do-we-talk-about-when-talking-about-containers-in-practice}

-   specific container image format
-   run-time environment
-   container registry API
-   Other stuff, hence there is a choice in how we can define how a container itself and its ecosystem is implemented. To standardize all this we have the OCI.
-   We have 3 specifications
    -   OCI Image spec
    -   OCI Runtime spec
    -   OCI Distribution spec (Container registry)


## OCI Specs {#oci-specs}


### OCI Image Specification {#oci-image-specification}

-   A series of tarballs called "layers".
-   Consists of a JSON configuration (containing environment variables, the path to execute, and so on)


#### Image creation w Dockerfile {#image-creation-w-dockerfile}

-   Create OCI images w [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) and [Podman]({{< relref "20230223192104-podman.md" >}}) CLI
-   From `Dockerfile` without Docker/Podman
    -   [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) : Build images w Dockerfile from environments without Docker, eg. from inside of a container.
    -   [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) : Can be used to created images w and w/o Dockerfile. [Podman]({{< relref "20230223192104-podman.md" >}}) uses it. Can create images from existing containers.

#### Image creation w/o Dockerfile {#image-creation-w-o-dockerfile}

Doing this gives you more flexibility eg. create image layers in parallel, decide how layers cache etc.

-   [jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) : OCI Images for java applications w/o Dockerfile and Docker
-   [ko](https://ko.build/) : For building OCI images for **no** CGO [Golang]({{< relref "20221101220915-golang.md" >}}) stuff.
-   [apko](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko) : Building OCI images directly from apk for alpine


### OCI Runtime {#oci-runtime}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230603000641-oci_ecosystem-995958410.png" >}}

-   Simply a program that implements the OCI Runtime spec, this program actually runs the container.
-   It does things like setting mounts, cgroups, ns(if using ns), loading processes, tears down etc.
-   It does not care about what is the actual implementation of the "container" is.
-   Examples
    -   Native runtimes
        -   `runc` (created by Docker)
        -   `crun` (tries to be faster than `runc`)
    -   Sandboxed runtimes
        -   `runsc` (oci runtime inside gvisor)
    -   Virtualized runtimes
        -   `firecracker-containerd` (uses containerd w firecracker)
        -   `kata containers` (uses qemu to create vm and run container there)


### OCI Distribution (Container registry) {#oci-distribution--container-registry}

Container registries are general purpose storage with the added benefit of being able to programmatically understand how the pieces are related.

-   They use the [distribution API](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#api)
-   Docker manages a big one: DockerHub, but you can host your [own](https://github.com/NicolasT/static-container-registry), use Quay, Harbor etc.
-   Related tools
    -   [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo)
        -   Does stuff w images and repositories
        -   copy images to/from container registries.
        -   inspect image without pulling etc.

## The engine and orchestrator {#the-engine-and-orchestrator}


### Container engines {#container-engines}

-   Helps us make use of `Image spec + Runtime + Dist`
-   Implements client side of the distribution
-   Interprets images
-   Launches containers using a runtime of its choice
-   Provides tools/APIs for managing images, processes, and storage.


#### by Docker team w CNCF {#by-docker-team-w-cncf}

-   [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) (This is the old docker, the whole thing as we know it)
-   `containerd` is embedded into Docker.
-   `containerd` ([K8s CRI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/) compatible)
    -   By Docker team w CNCF
    -   Uses `runc` for OCI runtime
    -   container processes are forked from `containerd` process.
    -   Included in docker, can be used standalone, or with CRI w [Kubernetes]({{< relref "20221102125748-kubernetes.md" >}}). Extensible w plugins.
    -   CRI compatible but not locked into k8s unlike `CRI-O`
    -   Uses grpc, **doesn't do** things like talk to registry etc. without additional software, containerd doesn't do anything differently from Docker, it just does less.
    -   Follows a **smart client** model
        -   When used with [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}), funny enough, `dockerd` is the smart client for `containerd`.
        -   When used w K8s, CRI plugin is the smart client.
        -   `ctr` (debugging), `nerdctl` (smart client for standalone `containerd`)


#### by RedHat team w CNCF {#by-redhat-team-w-cncf}

-   [Podman]({{< relref "20230223192104-podman.md" >}}) (for [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) replacement and better systemd support)
-   `CRI-O` (K8s CRI compatible)
    -   `CRI-O` is a separate project(K8s only), not embedded into [Podman]({{< relref "20230223192104-podman.md" >}})
    -   Uses `crun` for OCI runtime
    -   Developed in lockstep with the Kubernetes release cycle


### Container orchestrator (eg. K8s) {#container-orchestrator--eg-dot-k8s}

These basically scheduling and run containers using a `container engine`


#### K8s {#k8s}

![](/ox-hugo/20221102125748-kubernetes-1712265804.png)

-   The interface [Kubernetes]({{< relref "20221102125748-kubernetes.md" >}}) uses to interact w the container engine is named [CRI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/)
-   [Kubernetes]({{< relref "20221102125748-kubernetes.md" >}}) initially used `dockershim` as [Docker]({{< relref "20230209185925-docker.md" >}}) doesn't directly support CRI. Later things were changed, now K8s uses [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/)/ `containerd`
-   `dockershim` is deprecated and now maintained w a [new name by a third party.](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/mirantis-to-take-over-support-of-kubernetes-dockershim-2/)
-   Other than orchestrating containers, k8s can now also [do vms it seems.](https://kubevirt.io/)


#### Nomad {#nomad}

-   Simpler alternative to [Kubernetes]({{< relref "20221102125748-kubernetes.md" >}})
-   Single cli: Creates daemons called agents which can run in `server/client/both` modes.
