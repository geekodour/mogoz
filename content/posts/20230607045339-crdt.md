## CRDT Alternatives for text-editing and list manipulation {#crdt-alternatives-for-text-editing-and-list-manipulation}

-   you can "get away with" not using CRDTs in collaborative apps, especially with a server.
    -   For collaborative text editing and list manipulation, though
        -   I think list CRDTs are still the best option.
-   Traditional CRDT libraries (Yjs, Automerge, [Collabs](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs))
    -   You're given a data structure that does the CRDT magic but also controls the state of the whole list/text (or possibly your whole app).
-   [position-strings - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/position-strings)


## Things I keep hearing {#things-i-keep-hearing}


### Differential Data flow {#differential-data-flow}


### Others {#others}

-   Marc Shapiro - co-inventor of CRDTs (and proxy principle, too) is actually working on a highly available geo-replicated db. The project is called Antidote (white paper) and it's a part of a bigger european project called SyncFree.
-   [crdt]({{< relref "20230607045339-crdt.md" >}}) give strong [Eventual Consistency]({{< relref "20231117135755-eventual_consistency.md" >}})
-   My takeaways from experimenting with CRDTs were: (HN comment)
    -   In many cases, CRDTs didn’t improve upon last-write-wins, i.e. a CRDT update followed by another user’s CRDT update 10 seconds later is the same as last-write-wins
    -   Often the challenge was less technical, and centered around what a conflicted state means in the absence of a human discussion, i.e. how would you resolve a git merge conflict without human intervention, or if two people reschedule the meeting simultaneously one of them is likely to miss it unless they talk it out

### Notes from Internet {#notes-from-internet}

-   You don't really need webrtc to collaborative tech as you'll anyway need a signalling server. You might aswell use a centralized sync server [with something](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo) like [WebSockets]({{< relref "20230222181643-websockets.md" >}}).
-   If you need a decentralized user auth system, try @localfirst/auth.
