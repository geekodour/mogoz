## CRDT Alternatives for text-editing and list manip. {#crdt-alternatives-for-text-editing-and-list-manip-dot}

-   you can "get away with" not using CRDTs in collaborative apps, especially with a server.
    -   For collaborative text editing and list manipulation, though
        -   I think list CRDTs are still the best option.
-   Traditional CRDT libraries (Yjs, Automerge, [Collabs](https://github.com/composablesys/collabs))
    -   You're given a data structure that does the CRDT magic but also controls the state of the whole list/text (or possibly your whole app).
-   [position-strings - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/position-strings)


## Notes from internet {#notes-from-internet}

-   You don't really need webrtc to collaborative tech as you'll anyway need a signalling server. You might aswell use a centralized sync server [with something](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo) like [WebSockets]({{< relref "20230222181643-websockets.md" >}}).
-   If you need a decentralised user auth system, try @localfirst/auth.
