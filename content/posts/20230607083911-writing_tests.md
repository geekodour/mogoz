## TDD {#tdd}

-   red, green, refactor
    -   red: write a test that fails
    -   green: make the test pass
    -   refactor: refactor it into something u r proud of
-   These are usually unit tests


### Lean TDD {#lean-tdd}

1.  have fun
2.  use [tracer bullet test initially](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4047335/tracer-bullets-vs-prototypes)
3.  test behaviour not implementation
4.  developer source and test code together
5.  focus on valuable tests, write feature tests, test usps
6.  write test when you need them, refactor when u need to
