## FAQ {#faq}


### Snapshots vs Mock {#snapshots-vs-mock}

-   Snapshot: If you are testing what your API is supposed to respond with, that's called a snapshot and libraries like jest have it built in.
-   Mock: If you are testing how your code handles data that is coming from an external API, then that's called a mock. We have a sub-folder called something like "/tests/mocks" and they're just a sampling of different common API responses that my service is expected to handle. A unit test will grab a specific mock data file and process it according to the logic in my system, then the output is examined for accuracy.

## TDD {#tdd}

-   red, green, refactor
    -   red: write a test that fails
    -   green: make the test pass
    -   refactor: refactor it into something u r proud of
-   These are usually unit tests


### Lean TDD {#lean-tdd}

1.  have fun
2.  use [tracer bullet test initially](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4047335/tracer-bullets-vs-prototypes)
3.  test behavior not implementation
4.  developer source and test code together
5.  focus on valuable tests, write feature tests, test usp(s)
6.  write test when you need them, refactor when u need to
