## One of vs Each of {#one-of-vs-each-of}

-   `One-of types` are more commonly known as `sum types`
-   `each-of types` as more commonly known as `product types`.
-   [Ocaml]({{< relref "20230529194221-ocaml.md" >}}) Variants are like disjoint union
    -   Aka `tagged union`
    -   Variants are also known as `Algebraic Data types`
    -   Each value of a variant comes from one of many underlying sets
    -   Thus far each of those sets is just a single constructor hence has cardinality one
    -   Disjoint union is indeed sometimes written with a &Sigma; operator.

-   [Ocaml]({{< relref "20230529194221-ocaml.md" >}}) Tuples/records are like Cartesian product
    -   Each value of a tuple or record contains a value from each of many underlying sets.
    -   Cartesian product is usually written with a product operator &Pi; or x
