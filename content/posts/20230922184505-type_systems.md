-   `One-of types` are more commonly known as `sum types`
-   `each-of types` as more commonly known as `product types`.


### One of (SUM) {#one-of--sum}

-   [Ocaml]({{< relref "20230529194221-ocaml.md" >}}) Variants are like disjoint union
-   Aka `tagged union`
-   Variants are also known as `Algebraic Data types`
-   Each value of a variant comes from one of many underlying sets
-   Thus far each of those sets is just a single constructor hence has cardinality one
-   Disjoint union is indeed sometimes written with a &Sigma; operator.

-   OCaml variants actually combine several theoretically independent language features into one: sum types, product types, recursive types, and parameterized (polymorphic) types.

### Each of (PRODUCT) {#each-of--product}

-   [Ocaml]({{< relref "20230529194221-ocaml.md" >}}) Tuples/records are like Cartesian product
-   Each value of a tuple or record contains a value from each of many underlying sets.
-   Cartesian product is usually written with a product operator &Pi; or x


### Maybe {#maybe}

-   [Ocaml]({{< relref "20230529194221-ocaml.md" >}}) `option` are maybe types
