## FAQ {#faq}


### What tool to use for CAD? {#what-tool-to-use-for-cad}


#### On blender {#on-blender}

The main reason Blender isn't widely used for CAD is that it serves fundamentally different purposes from dedicated CAD software. Here's why:

1.  ****Different modeling paradigms****:
    -   Blender: Mesh-based modeling (polygons)
    -   CAD: Parametric solid modeling (mathematically precise)

2.  ****Key CAD features missing in Blender****:
    -   ****Parametric design****: Changes propagate throughout the model
    -   ****Constraint-based modeling****: Precise dimensional relationships
    -   ****History/feature tree****: Editable construction history
    -   ****Engineering precision****: Exact measurements and tolerances
    -   ****Manufacturing outputs****: Native STEP/IGES files for machining

While add-ons like CAD Sketcher add some parametric capabilities to Blender, professional CAD tools (Solidworks, Fusion 360, Inventor) are purpose-built for engineering and manufacturing workflows.

FreeCAD is gaining traction as an open-source alternative, but for professional engineering work, purpose-built CAD software remains the standard.


#### FreeCAD vs Fusion360 vs OnShape {#freecad-vs-fusion360-vs-onshape}

-   Fusion360 has some limitations
-   FreeCAD is good but not there yet
-   Onshape
