## Concerns with sentry {#concerns-with-sentry}

-   The way we're using sentry is per project which is fine for error tracking
-   But when distributed tracing is in play, it crosses project-boundaries. Which [seems to be a](https://sentry.io/features/cross-project-issues/) business plan feature. So you can't really do distributed tracing across your different projects in sentry unless you've a business plan?
-   The sentry performance UI expects each project to have a `Frontend`, `Backend` and `Mobile` [filter](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/filters-display/). Which doesn't fit nicely into how we've structured our services.
-   Discover page has limitations with the team plan
