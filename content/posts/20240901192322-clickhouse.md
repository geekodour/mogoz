## FAQ {#faq}


### Refresh-able materialized views {#refresh-able-materialized-views}

> -   For example, you may want to regularly perform a complete recomputation of a view over the full dataset because it `uses a complex join`, which is incompatible with an incremental approach.
> -   Eg. batch processes performing tasks such as denormalization.

-   These are not suitable for realtime needs
-   This gives you the [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) materialized view behaviour to clickhouse
-   I don't think they're needed for me at the moment, but can be useful in certain cases and is an experimental feature in CH.
-   [Refreshable Materialized View (experimental) | ClickHouse Docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/materialized-view/refreshable-materialized-view)


### Replication {#replication}

See [Data Replication]({{< relref "20231021151742-data_replication.md" >}})

-   Clickhouse in itself doesn't support replication but can support based on [Zookeeper]({{< relref "20221102125923-zookeeper.md" >}}) with Clickhouse Keeper.


### Serving/User facing data delivery {#serving-user-facing-data-delivery}

> -   Eg. Snowflake is a OLAP like clickhouse aswell but it's not meant to be usefacing
> -   Eg. I computed a MV and I want to make it accessible to the user

-   "ClickHouse is good to serve direct queries from users."
    -   Sorted :)
    -   See [Optimizing your customer-facing analytics experience with Luzmo and ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/blog/optimizing-your-customer-facing-analytics-experience-with-luzmo-and-clickhouse)
    -   See [Should ClickHouse be user facing for high frequency of requests? · ClickHouse/ClickHouse · Discussion #36688 · GitHub](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/discussions/36688)


### [DuckDB]({{< relref "20231123234702-duckdb.md" >}}) vs [Clickhouse]({{< relref "20240901192322-clickhouse.md" >}}) {#duckdb--20231123234702-duckdb-dot-md--vs-clickhouse--20240901192322-clickhouse-dot-md}

> -   I think [DuckDB]({{< relref "20231123234702-duckdb.md" >}}) is awesome but i consider more of a tool than a DB.
> -   It's more like a analysis tool. You can probably use clickhouse for all things that duckdb does but you can't do all things that clickhouse does in duckdb. Plus there's `clickhouse-local` which is a more apple-apple with duckdb.

-   DuckDB is in-process, not like a proper DB
-   DuckDB compares closest to other single node query engines like [Polars]({{< relref "20240510084554-polars.md" >}}), Data fusion, pandas.
-   Clickhouse stores the data on-disk like a normal database


## Materialized Views {#materialized-views}

> NOTE: This is about normal Materialized Views in CH, not refreshable MV, those are not of our concern

### How does it work for `Sync` and `Async` ingest? and delay. {#how-does-it-work-for-sync-and-async-ingest-and-delay-dot}

-   ClickHouse uniquely can efficiently update materialized views upon new data within a delay threshold.
-   Normal materialized views are realtime materilized views only but they're `not true realtime` like Druid.
-   Materialized View is an insert trigger the FROM table is the inserted buffe
-   `Sync Ingestion` and `Async Ingestion` work the same for CH materliazed views.
    -   See [Are Materialized Views inserted synchronously? | ClickHouse Docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/knowledgebase/are_materialized_views_inserted_asynchronously)
    -   i.e It's batched
-   Computation of MV is NOT ATOMIC. So there might be inconsistency. (rare case)
    -   See [MATERIALIZED VIEW inconsistency of data · Issue #19749 · ClickHouse/ClickHouse · GitHub](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/19749)


### Understanding the usecase of MV in CH {#understanding-the-usecase-of-mv-in-ch}

-   This means we need stream processing prior to ingestion, if that's the case what's the use of materlizaton even????
-   You can create MV with aggregations such as last 1h, last 1d, last 1w etc for certain something.

## Stream Processing v/s CH Materialized Views {#stream-processing-v-s-ch-materialized-views}

See [Stream Processing/Ingestion Patterns]({{< relref "20240901014444-stream_processing_ingestion_patterns.md" >}})

> What CH MV offers can be categorized as `continuous processing` in-contrast to `stream processing`. It works with some usecases but might not work with others, it's less powerful than true `stream processing` so we might find ourselves combining CH with some `stream processing` software if our needs become complex.


### Do we need `stream processing` if materalized views are there? {#do-we-need-stream-processing-if-materalized-views-are-there}

-   Depends on usecase. But usually stea
-   Also see [Stream Processing/Ingestion Patterns]({{< relref "20240901014444-stream_processing_ingestion_patterns.md" >}})


### Combining `stream processing` with MV {#combining-stream-processing-with-mv}

> -   "The key point is not to analyze data fast, but to analyze fresh and well-formatted data fast. That means data needs to be ingested and transformed in real time before analytics is performed."
> -   We usually would want the ingest "cleaned" data into our OLAP, in this case we'd put a stream processor infront of our OLAP system.

-   [Real-Time Data Enrichment and Analytics With RisingWave and ClickHouse](https://risingwave.com/blog/real-time-data-enrichment-and-analytics-with-risingwave-and-clickhouse/)
-   CH MV might not work best with complex JOINs, in those cases we might need a `stream processing` thing before we ingest the data into CH.
