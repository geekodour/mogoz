## vCPUs {#vcpus}

You always have at least one core, one die and one package.

| Name    | What                                                                                               |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Package | What you get when you buy a single processor. Contains one or more dies.                           |
| Die     | Actual silicon. A die can contain any number of cores                                              |
| Socket  | The physical connector linking the processor to the computerâ€™s motherboard. There can be multiple. |
| Core    | Independent execution unit that can run one program thread at a time in parallel with other cores. |
| vCPU    | vCPUs are compute threads that process execution for running os/vm.                                |


### vCPU calculation {#vcpu-calculation}

-   `(# Sockets)` \* `(# Cores)` = `(# pCPU)` (Physical CPU)
-   `(# pCPU)` \* `(2 Threads)` = `(# vCPU)` (Virtual CPU)

<!--listend-->

```text
Thread(s) per core:  2
Core(s) per socket:  4
Socket(s):           1
On-line CPU(s) list:   0-7 (8)

pCPU = 1 * 4 = 4
vCPU = 4*2 = 8
```

> **VMs and Hypervisors**
>
> Now the term vCPU is widely used in hypervisors etc. In those cases, most hypervisors will let you overprovision cores. That means, you could assign 1 vCPU per VM, but the hypervisors also allow you overcommit every vcpu if you think your workload could handle that.
