## What {#what}


### Basics {#basics}

-   X.509 ( See [X-Standards]({{< relref "20230301150107-x_standards.md" >}})) PKI enables each certificate to be signed by a single party: a certificate authority (CA).
-   It allows severs to be authenticated without requiring clients to manually install root certificates.
-   Bestows trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them.
-   One alternative to PKI is Web of Trust which [GPG / GNUPG]({{< relref "20230417082750-gpg.md" >}}) uses


### Main Components {#main-components}

-   Certificate Authorities (CAs) (See [TLS]({{< relref "20230210181907-tls.md" >}}))
-   Registration Authorities
-   Digital certificates
-   Public and private keys
-   Certificate revocation lists


## Key protocols {#key-protocols}

PKI does not necessarily mean asymmetric key encryption. For example, DH is used for PKI but it aims to create a symmetric key in the end. See [this](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2867/whats-the-fundamental-difference-between-diffie-hellman-and-rsa) and [this](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/797/is-diffie-hellman-mathematically-the-same-as-rsa) answer for more details.


### Diffie hellman {#diffie-hellman}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230417085602-pki-961341570.png" >}}

-   Relies on the hardness of taking logarithms (discrete logs)
-   DH uses a multiplicative group of [integers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526) modulo a prime p


### RSA {#rsa}

-   Relies on the hardness of factoring.


### DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) {#dsa--digital-signature-algorithm}

-   It weak, can be broken?


### Elliptic curve (ECC) {#elliptic-curve--ecc}

-   See [How does SSH use both RSA and Diffie-Hellman?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/76894/how-does-ssh-use-both-rsa-and-diffie-hellman)


#### Key exchange method {#key-exchange-method}

-   The key exchange yields the secret key which will be used to encrypt data for that session.
-   SSH uses DH to establish an ephemeral (ie: one time) key to establish forward-security.

<!--list-separator-->

-  ECDH

    -   Variant of DH that uses a multiplicative group of points on an elliptic curve
    -   Uses a curve
        -   NIST curve P-256
        -   Curve25519/cv25519/X25519


#### Signature schemes {#signature-schemes}

-   [SSH]({{< relref "20230320013331-ssh.md" >}}) uses RSA/ECC variants to establish an initial secure, authenticated connection
-   The signature is so that the client can make sure that it talks to the right server

<!--list-separator-->

-  ECDSA

    -   NIST produced, political concerns
    -   Can be susceptible to attacks. Underlying DSA.
    -   Just use Ed25519 instead

<!--list-separator-->

-  Ed25519

    -   Strongest so far

## Keys {#keys}


### Public key {#public-key}

-   Public key can be derived from the private key
-   They are meant to be public, fr. No point trying to keep it secret.
-   The design does not guarantee that the public key cannot be derived from the encrypted material.


### Private key {#private-key}

-   The design guarantee that the private key cannot be derived from the encrypted material.


## Encrypting {#encrypting}

See [Encryption]({{< relref "20230417114522-encryption.md" >}})


## Signing {#signing}

-   ORDERING MATTERS. Do due diligence. See [this](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/5458/should-we-sign-then-encrypt-or-encrypt-then-sign)
    -   It's suggested that we do `sign-then-encrypt`
    -   Because with `encrypt-then-sign` the sender might be unaware of the actual content of the message.
-   When X wants to send you an encrypted message, they'll use your `public key`.
-   So now you got a package that you think came from X.
    -   You open it, it's encrypted.
    -   You decrypt it, it gets decrypted. Nice.
    -   But now you have no idea, if that package was tampered or MITM'ed or something, because anyone with access to the `public key` can easily create a file that will pass any file modification tests
    -   This is why we need signing
-   When signing, X can sign the message with their `private key`.
    -   Now if you want to verify if it was `X` that sent the message
    -   You use `X`'s `public key` to verify that the message certainly came from `X`
    -   And ofc then use your own `private key` to decrypt rest of the message for yourself.
