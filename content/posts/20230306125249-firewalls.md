## Kernel packet filters {#kernel-packet-filters}

These are kernel specific

-   **Userland APIs/Frontends to netfilter**: iptables, nft, iptables-nft, conntrack etc.
-   **Configuration managers**: Firewalld, ufw, [opensnitch](https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch) etc.


## Linux firewalls {#linux-firewalls}

History: ipchains -&gt; [iptables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iptables) -&gt; [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_differences_with_iptables) / iptables-nft -&gt; bpf(?)


### iptables {#iptables}

-   See [iptables]({{< relref "20230309160055-iptables.md" >}}) for more info.
-   It's just a frontend to netfilter that deals with certain things. (Eg. `tc` controls another portion of netfilter)
-   It's more than a userland tool. It's a set of tools for different protocols. (Sometimes called `Xtables`)
    Different kernel modules and programs are currently used for different protocols
    -   `iptables` applies to IPv4
    -   `ip6tables` to IPv6
    -   `arptables` to ARP
    -   `ebtables` to Ethernet frames
-   `iptables` is deprecated, long live `iptables-nft`. The `iptables-nft` command uses the newer `nftables` kernel API but reuses the legacy packet-matching code.

```shell
λ readlink -f $(which iptables)
/usr/bin/xtables-nft-multi
λ  iptables -V
iptables v1.8.7 (nf_tables)
```


### nftables (nft) {#nftables--nft}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/iptables.png" >}}

-   iptables, ip6tables, arptables, ebtables simplified to just nftables.
-   nftables is what is implemented in current systems/kernels, they have glue/translation versions of iptables (`iptables-nft`) that internally write nftables rules into the system.


### BPF what? {#bpf-what}

> ⚠
> I am not sure about this one. I [asked a question](https://cilium.slack.com/archives/C1MATJ5U5/p1678097279712749) in the cilium slack about [this](https://cilium.io/blog/2018/04/17/why-is-the-kernel-community-replacing-iptables/) blogpost about BPF replacing existing firewall vs [these](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200608162027.iyaqtnhrjtp3vos5@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/) [newer](https://lwn.net/Articles/822744/) posts pointing otherwise but I got no response.

According to internet news, nftable is already deprecated in the future by Linux Kernel. The future will most likely be BPFilter, which is based on eBPF, but that is still several years out. They have to build the generic BPF/XDP system before they could build a full iptables/nftables/netfilter (maybe) replacement on top. Companies like Cilium, Facebook, and Cloudflare from jumping ahead and doing firewalling with the BPF parts that are already there.


### Learning path {#learning-path}

-   Learn iptables syntax first with `iptables-nft` (Lot of good learning materials)
-   Learn nftables, then maybe try out the config managers like firewalld.
-   See BPF / XDP if interested.

### ipset? {#ipset}

-   Initially, standard practice of ACLs implemented by iptables was to use sequential list of rules
    -   i.e. every packet Rx or Tx is matched against a list of rules, one by one.
-   As time passed and iptables grew, traversing sequential iptables lists had become unbearable from a performance and latency perspective.
    -   Issue: Long lists of rules either rejecting or allowing individual IP address and port combinations
-   Workaround: **ipset**, allows compressing list of rules matching on IP/port combinations into hash table reducing no. of rules.

### K8s {#k8s}

-   A huge part of the k8s ecosystem currently relies on iptables (kube-proxy). - Standard kube-proxy is just a lot of chains in the nat(`iptables -t nat -L -v`) and filter(`iptables -L -v`) tables and maybe some on the mangle table.
-   (old info): `kube-proxy` uses iptables and `-j DNAT` rules to provide load-balancing for services.
    -   Multiple iptables rules for each backend a service is serving to.
    -   Each service added, the list of iptables rules to traverse grows exponentially.
-   iptables lack of incremental updates. The entire list of rules has to be replaced each time a new rule is added. Eg. 5 hours to install the 160K iptables rules representing 20K k8s services.
