## Kernel packet filters {#kernel-packet-filters}

These are kernel specific


### OpenBSD {#openbsd}

### Linux {#linux}

[Netfilter - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter)

-   **Userland APIs/Frontends to netfilter**: iptables, nft, iptables-nft, conntrack etc.
-   **Configuration managers**: Firewalld, ufw, [opensnitch](https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch) etc.


## Linux firewalls {#linux-firewalls}

History: ipchains -&gt; [iptables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iptables) -&gt; [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_differences_with_iptables) / iptables-nft -&gt; bpf(?)


### iptables {#iptables}

-   It's just a frontend to netfilter that deals with certain things. (Eg. `tc` controls another portion of netfilter)
-   It's more than a userland tool. It's a set of tools for different protocols. (Sometimes called `Xtables`)
    Different kernel modules and programs are currently used for different protocols
    -   `iptables` applies to IPv4
    -   `ip6tables` to IPv6
    -   `arptables` to ARP
    -   `ebtables` to Ethernet frames
-   For `iptables`, the `filters` are organized in different `tables`, which contain `chains of rules` for how to treat network traffic packets.
    -   **Filter Table**: Control the flow of packets in and out of a system.
    -   **NAT Table**: Redirect connections to other interfaces on the network.
    -   **Mangle Table**: Modify packet headers.
-   `iptables` is deprecated, long live `iptables-nft`

```shell
λ readlink -f $(which iptables)
/usr/bin/xtables-nft-multi
```


### nftables (nft) {#nftables--nft}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/iptables.png" >}}

-   iptables, ip6tables, arptables, ebtables simplified to just nftables.
-   nftables is what is implemented in current systems/kernels, they have glue/translation versions of iptables (`iptables-nft`) that internally write nftables rules into the system.


### BPF what? {#bpf-what}

> ⚠
> I am not sure about this one. I [asked a question](https://cilium.slack.com/archives/C1MATJ5U5/p1678097279712749) in the cilium slack about [this](https://cilium.io/blog/2018/04/17/why-is-the-kernel-community-replacing-iptables/) blogpost about BPF replacing existing firewall vs [these](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20200608162027.iyaqtnhrjtp3vos5@ast-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/) [newer](https://lwn.net/Articles/822744/) posts pointing otherwise but I got no response.

According to internet news, nftable is already deprecated in the future by Linux Kernel. The future will most likely be BPFilter, which is based on eBPF, but that is still several years out. They have to build the generic BPF/XDP system before they could build a full iptables/nftables/netfilter (maybe) replacement on top. Companies like Cilium, Facebook, and Cloudflare from jumping ahead and doing firewalling with the BPF parts that are already there.


### Learning path {#learning-path}

-   Learn iptables syntax first with `iptables-nft` (Lot of good learning materials)
-   Learn nftables, then maybe try out the config managers like firewalld.
-   See BPF / XDP if interested.

-   A huge part of the k8s ecosystem currently relies on iptables (kube-proxy). - Standard kube-proxy is just a lot of chains in the nat(`iptables -t nat -L -v`) and filter(`iptables -L -v`) tables and maybe some on the mangle table.
