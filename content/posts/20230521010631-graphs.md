## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Common terms {#common-terms}


### Basic {#basic}

-   cycle: When you start at Node(x), follow the links, and end back at Node(x)
    -   Needs 3 nodes
    -   [data structures - In an undirected graph, the simplest cycle must have 3 node...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29242390/in-an-undirected-graph-the-simplest-cycle-must-have-3-nodes)
-   acyclic: A graph that contains no cycles
-   connected: When every node has a path to another node
-   directed: When there is a direction to the connections.
-   undirected: !directed.
-   weighted: The edges have a weight associated with them. Think Maps
-   dag: Directed, acyclic graph.


### Implementations {#implementations}

-   node: a point or vertex on the graph
-   edge: the connection betxit two nodes


### Big O {#big-o}

-   TODO This section should move to [Algorithms]({{< relref "20230205172402-algorithms.md" >}})
-   BigO is commonly stated in terms of V and E
-   0(V \* E) means that we will check every vertex, and on every vertex we check every edge


## Graph representation {#graph-representation}


### Adjacency List {#adjacency-list}

-   Popular use
-   List contains list of "what am i adjacent to"


### Adjacency Matrix {#adjacency-matrix}

-   Space complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\)
-   Not used much usually


### Graph Nodes {#graph-nodes}

-   Graph Nodes etc. like we do with linked list
-   But we don't do it this way in practice generally
