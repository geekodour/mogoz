-   Network that helps define and visualize relationships between various components
-   Layout of the graph is **not** part of the graph. Following two are the same graph

-   You can define different networks in the same data. Some networks are more useful than others.

-   Possible use
    -   Can be used in infinite ways. If you can make your data look like a graph, you can reuse a wide variety of graph algorithms.
    -   Eg. You [could represent your](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/grids/graphs.html) gameâ€™s economy as a graph, with wheat and bread as nodes and baking as an edge.

### Basic terms {#basic-terms}

-   \\(0(V \* E)\\) means that we will check every vertex, and on every vertex we check every edge
    -   \\(V\\) / Node : Set of vertices
    -   \\(E\\) / Edge : Set of edges, connection btwn nodes
-   `Path`: Sequence of `vertices` connected by `edges`
-   `Connectivity`
    -   `Verted:Connected:` 2 `vertices` are `connected` is there's a `path` connecting them
    -   `Graph:Connected`: When every node has a path to another node
    -   `Connected Component`

### Common problems {#common-problems}

-   Does a path exist
-   Is the graph connected
-   What's the shortest path
-   Does it contain cycle
-   Given a set of k colors, can we assign colors to each vertex so that no two neighbors are assigned the same color? (Sudoku problem)
-   Does a path exist that uses every `edge` exactly once?
-   Does a path exist that uses every `vertex` exactly once? (NP Hard, See [Complexity Theory]({{< relref "20230422182641-complexity_theory.md" >}}))

## Flavors {#flavors}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230521010631-graphs-1526145901.png" >}}

-   In the diagram, \\(n(n-1)\\), \\(n(n-1)/2\\) is the max number of edges.


### Cycle {#cycle}


#### Cyclic {#cyclic}

-   `Path` that starts and ends in the same `vertex`. All `Cycles` are `Path`, but not opposite.
-   A graph can have multiple cycles
-   When you start at Node(x), follow the links, and end back at Node(x)
-   Needs 3 nodes
-   Odd/Even cycles
    -   `odd` : `odd` no of `vertices` in the cycle
    -   `even` : `even` no of `vertices` in the cycle


#### Acyclic {#acyclic}

A graph that contains no cycles


#### DAG {#dag}

Directed, acyclic graph.

### Partite {#partite}


#### k-partite {#k-partite}

-   A graph whose vertices are (or can be) partitioned into k different independent sets.
-   Recognition of \\(k>2\\) is NP-complete


#### 2-partite (bipartite) {#2-partite--bipartite}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230521010631-graphs-1013550646.png" >}}

-   aka `2-colorable`
-   If there exists and partition of the vertex set into two `disjoint-sets`
    -   i.e \\(V\_1\\) has no adjacent vertices &amp; \\(V\_2\\) has no adjacent vertices
    -   If they're adjacent then one of them is in \\(V\_1\\) and other one is in \\(V\_2\\)
-   Bipartite graphs may be recognized in polynomial time
-   Bipartite graphs **cannot** have any `odd cycles`. i.e `odd cycles` not allowed.
    -   Eg. triangle has 3 `vertices`, and is a `cycle`. So triangle is not bipartite.

-  Types

    -   `Complete`: Every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set.
        ![](/ox-hugo/20230521010631-graphs-554952760.png)
    -   `Matching`: Each vertex is connected to at most one other vertex from the opposite set.
    -   `Planar`: Can be embedded in the plane without any edges crossing.

### Others {#others}

-   `Regular`: Every vertex has the same degree.
-   `Multigraph`: Allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
    -   Eg. Being able to swim across a river or take a raft across the same river is an example in games.


## Graph representation {#graph-representation}


### Adjacency Matrix {#adjacency-matrix}

-   \\(G=(V,E)\\) with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(m\\) edges
    -   \\(M\\) is a matrix with \\(n \texttimes n\\)
    -   \\(M[i,j] = 1\\) if \\((i,j) \in E\\)
    -   \\(M[i,j] = 0\\) if \\((i,j) \notin E\\)
-   Space complexity is \\((O(n^2)\\)
    -   Has entry for no-edges
    -   Has double entry for undirected edges


### Adjacency List {#adjacency-list}

![](/ox-hugo/20230521010631-graphs-900100462.png)
![](/ox-hugo/20230521010631-graphs-1860911803.png)
![](/ox-hugo/20230521010631-graphs-2119891008.png)

-   `Nx1` array of pointers
-   Each element(vertex(\\(i\\))) points to a linked list of edges incident on vertex \\(i\\)
-   The direction/order of items in the "edge list" for each "vertex" do not tell anything about if there any network exists between a edge items themselves.
    -   i.e `A: [B, C]`, this means `A` is connected to `B` and `C` but tells us nothing about the relation of `B` and `C`. This can be confusing because `B` and `C` are next to each other in a link list. In other words, link list is just the implementation and not the logical view.
-   List contains list of "what am i adjacent to"
-   Each vertex (`N`) has set of edges (`M`). No of edges per vertex is called the `degree`
    -   So, in a way no. of `neighbors` of some `vertex` is the `degree`
-   Space complexity
    -   Sparse
        -   Space Complexity
            -   \\(\theta(N+2M) = \theta(n)\\) (undirected) or \\(\theta(N+M) = \theta(n)\\) (directed)
            -   total `N` vertices (items in array)
            -   total `M` edges
            -   In undirected, each connected `N` has the edge mentioned both ways. So `2M`
    -   Dense
        -   Space Complexity: \\(\theta(N\*N) = \theta(n^2)\\)


### Graph Nodes {#graph-nodes}

-   Graph Nodes etc. like we do with linked list
-   But we don't do it this way in practice generally
