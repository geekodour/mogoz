## Common terms {#common-terms}


### Intro {#intro}

-   \\(0(V \* E)\\) means that we will check every vertex, and on every vertex we check every edge
    -   \\(V\\) / Node : Set of vertices
    -   \\(E\\) / Edge : Set of edges, connection btwn nodes
-   You can define different networks in the same data. Some networks are more useful than others.

### Flavors {#flavors}

### Basic {#basic}

-   Cycle: When you start at Node(x), follow the links, and end back at Node(x)
    -   Needs 3 nodes
    -   [data structures - In an undirected graph, the simplest cycle must have 3 node...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29242390/in-an-undirected-graph-the-simplest-cycle-must-have-3-nodes)
-   Acyclic: A graph that contains no cycles
-   Connected: When every node has a path to another node
-   Directed: When there is a direction to the connections.
-   Undirected: !directed.
-   Weighted: The edges have a weight associated with them. Think Maps
-   DAG: Directed, acyclic graph.


## Graph representation {#graph-representation}


### Adjacency Matrix {#adjacency-matrix}

-   Not used much usually
-   \\(G=(V,E)\\) with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(m\\) edges
    -   \\(M\\) is a matrix with \\(n \texttimes n\\)
    -   \\(M[i,j] = 1\\) if \\((i,j) \in E\\)
    -   \\(M[i,j] = 0\\) if \\((i,j) \notin E\\)
-   Space complexity is \\((O(n^2)\\)
    -   Has entry for no-edges
    -   Has double entry for undirected edges


### Adjacency List {#adjacency-list}

-   Popular use
-   `Nx1` array of pointers
-   Each element(vertex(\\(i\\))) points to a linked list of edges incident on vertex \\(i\\)
-   The direction/order of items in the "edge list" for each "vertex" do not tell anything about if there any network exists between a edge items themselves.
    -   i.e `A: [B, C]`, this means `A` is connected to `B` and `C` but tells us nothing about the relation of `B` and `C`. This can be confusing because `B` and `C` are next to each other in a link list. In other words, link list is just the implementation and not the logical view.
-   List contains list of "what am i adjacent to"
-   Each vertex (`N`) has set of edges (`M`). No of edges per vertex is called the `degree`
-   Space complexity
    -   Sparse
        -   Space Complexity
            -   \\(\theta(N+2M) = \theta(n)\\) (undirected) or \\(\theta(N+M) = \theta(n)\\) (directed)
            -   total `N` vertices (items in array)
            -   total `M` edges
            -   In undirected, each connected `N` has the edge mentioned both ways. So `2M`
    -   Dense
        -   Space Complexity: \\(\theta(N\*N) = \theta(n^2)\\)


### Graph Nodes {#graph-nodes}

-   Graph Nodes etc. like we do with linked list
-   But we don't do it this way in practice generally
