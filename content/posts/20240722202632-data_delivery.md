## Guarantees {#guarantees}

See [The Dodgy State of Delivery Guarantees - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmpBOCvY8mY)


### at-most-once {#at-most-once}

> Send request, don't retry, update may not happen


### at-least-once {#at-least-once}

> Retry request until `acknowledged`, may repeat update


### exactly-once {#exactly-once}

> -   `exactly-once` = `at-least-once` + Idempotence
> -   exactly-once = (retry + idempotence) or deduplication
> -   It's similar to TCP/IP. You implement a control protocol on top of an unreliable underlying protocol.

-   "You are talking about distributed systems, nobody expects to read "exactly once" delivery."
-   "In my experience, the purist version of "exactly-once" exists as a vague, wishy-washy mental model in the brains of developers who have never thought hard about this stuff"
-   "Within the context of a distributed system, you cannot have exactly-once message delivery."
-   How it's achieved is via sort of [faking it](https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/)
    -   `idempotency`: Either the messages themselves should be idempotent, meaning they can be applied more than once without adverse effects
    -   `de-duplication`: Or we remove the need for idempotency through deduplication of messages in the queue.
    -   `transactional processing`: If processing of the message and then updating its status back to the queue is done in the same transaction(can be rolled back) that too can be a way I think. The transaction can be distributed or not.
-   Even if something offers this gurantee, it's better to write code in an idempotent manner


#### De-Duplication {#de-duplication}

-   SQS FIFO queues have a 5-minute deduplication period. AWS is hashing the message body, saving the hash (for 5 minutes) and then each inbound message is hashed and a lookup is done on existing hashes to see if this one is a 'duplicate'. This is how AWS SQS is probably able to offer `exactly-once` gurantee.
    -   For such de-duplication service to be actually viable we have to have some kind of availability guarantee. With some kind of quorum this is possible. (See [Consensus Protocols]({{< relref "20231118205116-consensus_protocols.md" >}}))

### Some comments from one of my queue implementations in pg that i did for a client {#some-comments-from-one-of-my-queue-implementations-in-pg-that-i-did-for-a-client}

This was inspired by ideas of `river queue` but we did not have the requirement of [transactional enqueueing](https://riverqueue.com/docs/transactional-enqueueing) as this was part of a data pipeline and not userfacing stuff.


#### Queuing behavior {#queuing-behavior}

-   queueing is not idempotent, you're allowed to queue the same item again and again and it'll keep creating duplicates which will mutate the state of the queue.
-   We could however have de-duplication by adding some identity hash etc but guess not worth the effort atm
-   function which will push items into is responsible for checking if the items need to be queued or not. Once item is in the queue it'll be processed.


#### Processing guarantees {#processing-guarantees}

-   processing of items from the queue is guranteed at-least-once execution,
-   there is possibility of re-runs. processing of message should be idempotent.
-   When updating the state/staus of the message, it can be done in either:
    -   A: different db transactions(sometimes this is unavoidable)
    -   B: same db transactions(ensures that re-runs always start in fresh state)
    -   eitherway, this should not be a problem if the entire nature of processing of a message is idempotent
