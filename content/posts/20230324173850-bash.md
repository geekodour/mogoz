## Config files {#config-files}

> -   `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc` are specific to bash
> -   Whereas `.profile` is read by many shells in the absence of their own shell-specific config files.
> -   `.profile` was used by the original bourne shell.


### Login shells (eg. ssh sessions) {#login-shells--eg-dot-ssh-sessions}

-   `.bash_profile` or `.profile` is read by login shells, along with `.bashrc`
-   `tmux` by default runs login shells when you open new panes/windows, you can configure it to spin non-interactive shells
-   It login shells, `.bashrc` is not automatically sourced, `.profile` or `.bash_profile` needs to source it


### Sub shells/Non-interactive shells {#sub-shells-non-interactive-shells}

-   `.bashrc` is for non-login shell.
-   But for subshells, `.bashrc` is executed automatically
-   subshells inherit the parent(login shell's) environment. So you'd not want to keep setting env vars again and again, so you'd set them in `.bash_profile`
