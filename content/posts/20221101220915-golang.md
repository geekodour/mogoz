## Compiling, Linking and OS dependencies {#compiling-linking-and-os-dependencies}


### Syscalls {#syscalls}


#### How does go make syscalls? {#how-does-go-make-syscalls}

-   [Differs](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/n8iq0f/how_does_the_rust_standard_library_work/) by [Operating](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/lapzam/go_116_will_make_system_calls_through_libc_on/) [system](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/uX8eUeyuuAY)
-   In Linux, because it has a [stable ABI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55735864/how-does-go-make-system-calls), it makes the syscalls directly skipping `libc`. w Linux, the kernel to userspace interface is stable(which syscalls use), but the [in kernel interfaces are not stable](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/stable-api-nonsense.rst).
-   Enabling or disabling `CGO` has nothing to do with whether or not go syscall goes via `libc`, the C code used via `CGO` ofcourse will use `libc`.
-   Go does create wrappers around some syscalls (TODO: Need to dig into this)
-   Support for different syscalls in different OS is incremental. Eg. If `X` syscall is available in OS `A` and `B`. Go might have support for `X` only in `A` as of the moment.


#### Places where go handles syscalls {#places-where-go-handles-syscalls}

-   Try `fd syscall -t` on the go source tree.
-   [/syscall](https://pkg.go.dev/syscall@go1.20.2) : [Frozen](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/jt1qfm/syscall_package_deprecated_question/), except for changes needed to maintain the core repository.
-   [/internal/syscall](https://pkg.go.dev/internal/syscall@go1.20.2) : internal
-   [/runtime/internal/syscall](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/internal/syscall) : internal, [some details](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoSchedulerAndSyscalls)
-   [/x/sys](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sys)
    -   This is where new stuff goes and should be used by callers
    -   Contains 3 packages to hold their syscall implementations(Unix, Windows and Plan 9)
    -   Has the wrapper creation libraries such as [mkwinsyscall.go](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/sys/+/refs/tags/v0.6.0:windows/mkwinsyscall/mkwinsyscall.go) and [mksyscall.go](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/sys/+/refs/tags/v0.6.0:unix/mksyscall.go)


### Portability {#portability}

-   syscalls are not portable by nature, they are specific to the system. We need to add a build tag for the ARCH and OS that syscall invocation is valid for.

    -   You can also statically link with musl, but note that musl lacks features that people might want to use non-pure Go in the first place. For example, musl does't support arbitrary name resolvers, e.g. no LDAP support; it only supports DNS, just like the pure Go net package.
    -   On the other hand musl does support os/user.

### CGO {#cgo}

`CGO` is essentially utilizing C api calls to shared libraries exporting C interface. It is a [tradeoff](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go).


#### Using CGO {#using-cgo}

-   `CGO_ENABLED=1`
-   Some things are only available as C libraries, re-implementing that in Go would be costly.
-   CGO is also used in some parts of standard library. Eg. ([net](https://pkg.go.dev/net#hdr-Name_Resolution) and os/user). It's not a strict requirement though, you can use these packages w/o CGO and they'll use stripped down version written in Go. But if you want the full thing, you have no other option than to enable `CGO`

### Cross Compilation {#cross-compilation}


#### General cross compilation ideas {#general-cross-compilation-ideas}

-   Cross compiler: Compiler capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running on.
-   Levels (can be one or many)
    -   Architecture: MIPS/x86/arm
    -   Vendors: Mostly `unknown`
    -   OS: FreeBSD/Linux
    -   ABI: msul libc/glibc
-   `sysroot`: Directory which is considered to be the root directory for the purpose of locating headers and libraries.
-   `toolchain`: The set of compiler, linker, shared libs, any tools needed to produce the executable for the target.


#### Cross compilation in Golang {#cross-compilation-in-golang}

-   Unless you're using a native cross compiler(eg. Clang, Golang Compiler), to cross-compile a program, you need to separately build and install a complete gcc+binutils toolchain for every individual arch that you want to target.
-   Which Go this is easy(cross compiler out of the box) + dependencies ensured to support.


#### Cross compilation and CGO {#cross-compilation-and-cgo}

`CGO` allows us to access C libraries in the system we're building/compiling on. It has no idea about C libraries of other systems. So mostly CGO is disabled by default if cross-compiling. However, if you need to cross-compile go code with `CGO`, you need a cross-compiling C compiler for the target machine. It can be done but it is a bit of PITA.

## Packages and Modules {#packages-and-modules}

<div class="warning small-text">

> -   Read [Go Modules Reference](https://go.dev/ref/mod#glos-vendor-directory)
> -   module-aware mode is the way 2 go me fren. (GO111MODULE=""/auto)
> -   ditch gopath
</div>


### Meta notes {#meta-notes}

-   `package path` and `module path` may look similar, the difference lies in the existence of `go.mod` file inside the directory. i.e Repository root need not be the place where the `module` is defined.


### Packages {#packages}

-   `package path` / `import path`
    -   Identity of a package
    -   `module path` + subdirectory
    -   Eg. `golang.org/x/net/html`
-   Each directory that has Go source code inside, possibly including the root directory, is a `package`.
-   Example: `x/...` matches `x` as well as `x`'s subdirectories.


### Module {#module}

-   The tree(`module`) with branches(`packages`) and leafs(`*.go` files) growing on branches.
-   `packages` sharing the same lifecycle(`version number`) are bundled into a `module`.
-   `module path`
    -   Defined in the `go.mod` file by the `module directive`
    -   Identity of a module
    -   Acts as a prefix for `package` import paths within the module.
    -   Eg. `golang.org/x/net`, `golang.org/x/tools/gopls`


### module cache v/s module vendoring {#module-cache-v-s-module-vendoring}

<div class="warning small-text">

> As of May'23,
>
> -   Default behavior is, if `vendor/` directory is present, the go command acts as if `-mod=vendor` otherwise `-mod=readonly`. I think sane defaults.
</div>


#### module cache {#module-cache}

-   When `-mod=mod` (This is what `go get` and `go mod tidy` does, doesn't need the flag)
-   Downloaded `modules` are stored in `GOMODCACHE` and made `read-only`. This cache may be shared by multiple Go projects developed on the same machine.


#### vendor {#vendor}

-   When `-mod=vendor`, go command will use the `vendor/` directory
-   Will **not** use the network or the `module cache`
-   Why vendor?
    -   Helps to ensure that all files used for build are in a single file tree.
    -   No network access we can build stuff always (we supposed to push the vendor to vcs)
-   Useful things to know about vendoring
    -   Local changes should not be made to vendored packages. Workspaces can probably help here.
    -   go mod vendor omits go.mod and go.sum files for vendored dependencies
    -   go mod vendor records the go version for each deps in vendor/modules.txt
    -   `go get, go mod download, go mod tidy` will bypass vendor directory and download stuff as expected


### Semantic versioning &amp; versions from VCS {#semantic-versioning-and-versions-from-vcs}

-   A version identifies an immutable snapshot of a `module`. Each version starts with the letter `v` + semantic versioning.
-   `v0.0.0, v1.12.134, v8.0.5-pre, v9.2.2-beta+meta and v2.0.9+meta` are valid versions.


#### VCS and pseudo versioning {#vcs-and-pseudo-versioning}

-   We can also get `modules` from VCS using `tags/branches/revisions/commits` that don’t follow semantic versioning.
-   In these cases, the go command will replace `golang.org/x/net@daa7c041` with `v0.0.0-20191109021931-daa7c04131f5`.
-   This is called `pseudo-version`. You usually won't be typing a pseudo version by hand.


#### Why separate directory for Major versions {#why-separate-directory-for-major-versions}

<div class="warning small-text">

> Golden rule:
> If an old package and a new package have the same import path
> &rArr; The new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.
</div>

-   `v0` / `pre-release` suffix: Unstable, doesn't need to be backwards compatible. No major version suffix directory allowed. So when starting new projects be under `v0` as long as possible.
-   `v1` : Defines the compatibility/stability. No major version suffix directory allowed.
-   `v2` / `v2+`  : Since major version bump by definition means breaking changes, by the golden rule, we need it to have separate module path.


### Building {#building}


#### What happens when go command tries to load a package? {#what-happens-when-go-command-tries-to-load-a-package}

-   When we try to load a `package`, indirectly we need to find the `module path`
-   It first looks into the `build list`, if not found it'll try to fetch the `module` (latest version) from a `module proxy` mentioned in the `GOPROXY` env var.
-   `go tidy` / `go get` does this automatically.


#### Generating build list {#generating-build-list}

-   When we run the go command, a list of final module versions is prepared from the `go.mod` file of `main module` + `transitively required modules` using minimal version selection. This final list of `module+version` is used for `go{build,list,test,etc}`. This is the `build list`
-   `// indirect` : This is added to `go.mod` of main module, when module is not directly required in the `main module`. So you should have all the dependencies in the `go.mod` file.


### Workspaces {#workspaces}

-   New feature 1.18+
-   You’re not meant to commit `go.work` files. They are meant for local changes only.
-   Has `use` and `replace` directives that can be useful for scratch work


### Module Proxy {#module-proxy}

-   module proxy is an HTTP server that can respond to GET requests for certain paths
-   We don't have a central package authority in the vein of `npm` or `crates.io`. Go modules have no `names`, only `paths`. The package management system uses the `package path/module path` to learn how to get the package. If it can't find the package locally, it'll try getting it from a `module proxy`.
-   module proxy related vars: `GOPRIVATE`, `GONOPROXY`, `GOPROXY="https://proxy.golang.org,direct"`
-   Different module proxies can have their own conventions (Eg. `gopkg.in` has some diff conventions)

## Project organization and dependencies {#project-organization-and-dependencies}


### Standard Library {#standard-library}

-   In tree : You can find these in the go source tree. Check [Standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std)
-   Out of tree : Part of go but out of tree, at `/x`. Check [Sub-repositories](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x)

## Language topics {#language-topics}


### Pointers {#pointers}

-   There's no pointer arithmetic in go
-   Go guarantees that, thing being pointed to will continue to be valid for the lifetime of the pointer.
    ```go
    func f() *int {
            i := 1
            return &i
    } // Go will arrange memory to store i after f returns.
    ```


### Context {#context}

-   It's not possible for a function that takes a `context.Context` and cancel it.
-   All it could do is `newCtx, cancel := context.WithCancel(origCtx)`.
-   In that case, when `cancel()` is called `newCtx` will be canceled, but `origCtx` will not.
-   `newCtx` will have access to the same values as `origCtx` and will be canceled either when `cancel()` is called or `origCtx` is canceled
-   More on context: [Break The Golang Context Chain » Rodaine](https://rodaine.com/2020/07/break-context-cancellation-chain/)
-   Even more: [Chris's Wiki blog/programming/GoContextValueMistake](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoContextValueMistake)


### Maps {#maps}

-   Go Maps are hashmap. O(1) ACR, O(n) WCR
-   A Map value is a pointer to a `runtime.hmap` structure.
-   Since it's a pointer, it should be written as `*map[int]int` instead of `map[int]int`. Go team changed this historically cuz it was [confusing anyway](https://dave.cheney.net/2017/04/30/if-a-map-isnt-a-reference-variable-what-is-it).
-   Maps change it's structure
    -   When you insert or delete entries
    -   The map may need to rebalance itself to retain its O(1) guarantee
-   What the compiler does when you use map
    ```go
    v := m["key"]     // → runtime.mapaccess1(m, ”key", &v)
    v, ok := m["key"] // → runtime.mapaccess2(m, ”key”, &v, &ok)
    m["key"] = 9001   // → runtime.mapinsert(m, ”key", 9001)
    delete(m, "key")  // → runtime.mapdelete(m, “key”)
    ```
