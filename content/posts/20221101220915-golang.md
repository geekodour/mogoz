## Installation and package management {#installation-and-package-management}


### Installation {#installation}

-   Do not want ~/go

<!--listend-->

```shell
export GOPATH=~/Projects/go
```


### Go Proxy {#go-proxy}

-   What's the lag between pushing to github and go install $name@latest getting the latest commit?
-   go uses a proxy, That proxy regularly updates from the original repository
-   try GOPROXY=direct go install $name@latest
-   <https://goproxy.io/>
-   <https://proxy.golang.org/>


## Random Guidelines {#random-guidelines}

-   The **name** of a variable, or a constant, should describe its purpose.
-   **Comments** on variables and constants should describe their contents not their purpose.
-   Name your package for what it provides, not what it contains.
-   **guard clauses**; conditional blocks with assert preconditions upon entering a function. return early.
-   If you assign nil to a slice and the slice will have zero len and zero cap and no longer point an underlying array.
-   global variables become an invisible parameter to every function in your program! Any function that relies on the state of a global variable can be broken if another part of the program changes that variable.
-   Go features first class support for concurrency with channels, and the select and go statements.
-   Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
-   Always close channels from sending side.
-   Go maps are sort of live in the heap or something ([Full details here](https://dave.cheney.net/2018/05/29/how-the-go-runtime-implements-maps-efficiently-without-generics)), so if you want to keep the pointer to the slice or other stuff you gotta do what you gotta do.


## Conversations {#conversations}

-   `./…`: An import path is a pattern if it includes one or more "..." wildcards, each of which can match any string. Example: `x/...` matches `x` as well as `x`'s subdirectories.
-   About `Context.context`: I had a [conversation on slack about `Contexts`](https://gophers.slack.com/archives/C02A8LZKT/p1588549175026200). It's not possible for a function that takes a `context.Context` and cancel it. All it could do is `newCtx, cancel :` context.WithCancel(origCtx)=. In that case, when `cancel()` is called `newCtx` will be canceled, but `origCtx` will not. Additionally, when you're passing context to a some function; the original context can be used to cancel the request early. The provided context can't be cancelled by the HTTP client. `newCtx` will be canceled either when `cancel()` is called or `origCtx` is canceled, so in a manner of speaking it inherits from it. It will also have access to the same values as `origCtx` does.

## Cross Compilation {#cross-compilation}

<div class="warning small-text">

> IMPORTANT: I think i might have mixed static linking and cross compilation here. Clear the mess.
</div>

Go can cross compile for different architecture and operating systems.

What's different about Go compared to more old-school languages:

-   Go binary distribution includes the cross-compilers right out of the box. So one can cross-compile their application and importantly, all of its library dependencies
-   If you want to cross-compile a C program, you need to separately build and install a complete gcc+binutils toolchain for every individual arch that you want to target.

### CGO {#cgo}

```shell
CGO_ENABLED=1 CC=musl-gcc go build --ldflags '-linkmode external -extldflags=-static'
```


### Without using CGO {#without-using-cgo}

-   Many times that a go binary, even if it has no cgo or cgo dependencies, will randomly require glibc on the target system to execute if you don't explicitly disable cgo in your build. `CGO_ENABLED=0`
