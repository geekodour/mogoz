## Comments from the interwebs {#comments-from-the-interwebs}

-   Microservices create boundaries between functionality, and a high degree of friction to moving it. Itâ€™s usually bad news if you discover an architectural problem that crosses process boundaries.
-   You will be better off building a more monolithic system first and keeping an open discussion about what parts of the code would be good candidates for splitting off, and being fairly careful of moving forward with such efforts in the face of dissenting opinion.
-   recommend learning about domain driven design as this lends itself extremely well to service oriented architectures
