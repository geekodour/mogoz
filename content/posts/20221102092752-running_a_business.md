#### FAQ {#faq}

<!--list-separator-->

    -   24(2Y)-36(3Y) runaway + 25% buffer
    -   Carta has the median time from seed to Series A as 23 months.

-  Pre-req before going to investor

    -   Have conviction
    -   Validate
        -   “Validate the customer’s needs and your unique product insight. Speak with buyers (100+ in the consumer space, 30+ in SMB, 10+ in enterprise) to deeply understand their pain point, and offer them your solution in the most realistic way possible (a prototype is better than a pitch deck) and name a price. You’re looking for at least 40% of ‘wow!’ and ‘when can I get this?.’ Anything less is just people being nice to you.”
    -   MVP
        -   You have some expression of your thesis. At the most, you have built a simple product and have some paying customers. At the least, you have a clear written memo and/or deck that outlines what you plan to build

-  Attack vectors

    -   Raising a seed round comes down to activating emotional triggers in prospective investors, including the fear of missing an incredible opportunity.
    -   The most surefire to get a yes from many investors is to get a yes from other investors.
    -   Mystery is always more seductive than the truth. Never reveal the actual names of who gave you a term sheet. Just accurately describe them in the abstract (and never lie).

<!--list-separator-->

-  Fundraising period

    -   2-3 week window on your to run your fundraise and speak to investors.
    -   Ideally, you want to speak to as many investors as possible in the shortest period of time.
    -   research each investor before your pitch window
        -   invested in similar companies
        -   check size and investment philosophy
        -   do they lead?
        -   What do other founders think of them?
    -   INTRO
        -   Take the time to consider your most powerful connection to each investor

-  Pitch Deck

    -   A minimal deck and/or memo with a simple budget is all that you’ll need at this stage.
    -   show
        -   there’s a real problem to solve
        -   a big enough market
        -   that you’re the one to solve it.
    -   Ensure good quality
    -   Have all your materials polished and ready to go before your pitch window
    -   Tailor your pitch to each prospective investor.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Presentation

        -   Presence in a meeting matters even more than your materials. Showing up as the best version of your authentic, relaxed, and confident self is key.
        -   Prepare your pitch by writing a memo. (may/maynot share it with investors but write the memo)
        -   Start real pitches with less important investors so you can iterate.
        -   If you don’t know, simply say, “I don’t know, but I’ll get that answer for you.”
        -   Acknowledge competitors factually
            -   including their strengths.
            -   promptly move on to your strengths and your vision
            -   Avoid disparaging competitors or spending too much time on them.

-  Investor Types

    -   Lead Investor: This is not needed for seed round
    -   Angels
        -   Rather open a `SAFE` (simple agreement for future equity) at reasonable valuation
        -   start collecting the checks of smaller angels while you are having conversations with larger funds.
        -   In seed, a term sheet is commonly a SAFE with a post-money cap.
        -   Rounds are actually not closed until the funds wire.


## Culture {#culture}

> I am the last person I'd go for business advice. These are just random thoughts that I'd **probably** like to experiment with someday.

-   Have some kind of company culture that puts out interesting thing on the internet that slightly diverges from what your company actually does. Example could be running a [TIL site](https://til.hashrocket.com/) that could benifit anyone from the Internet but the contents of it are from employees. So you've a new way to reach people and your employee have fun doing so aswell.
-   4 fits
    -   problems that u are solving
    -   the channels that u use to reach the customer (business model)
    -   the product / solution
-   You need to have a business idea not a product idea
