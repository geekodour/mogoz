## Variables {#variables}

```cpp
int a = b // setting a's VALUE to b's VALUE
int* a = &b // setting a's VALUE to the ADDRESS of b, a is a pointer here
int& a = b // setting a's ADDRESS to b's ADDRESS (a is a reference to b)
// The last line is a reference variable, C does not have it, Go lang does not have it
```
