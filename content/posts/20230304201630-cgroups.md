## Two definitions {#two-definitions}

-   A Linux kernel feature which allow processes to be organized into hierarchical groups whose usage of various types of resources can then be limited and monitored.
-   A cgroup is a collection of processes that are bound to a set of limits or parameters defined via the cgroup filesystem.


## cgroups vs ulimit {#cgroups-vs-ulimit}


### ulimit {#ulimit}

-   A limit of 2 GiB main memory applies to a single process (and its threads). And a child process of this process inherits also a limit of 2 GiB main memory, but this is 2 GiB for its own usage.
-   In other words, each process would have a limit of 2 GiB, and together they could consume up to 4 GiB of main memory.


### cgroups {#cgroups}

-   So, control groups allow to limit resources over a group of processes.
-   Limiting the main memory to 2 GiB for a group containing 3 processes, means the main memory used by all 3 processes together may not exceed 2 GiB.


## Interface {#interface}

-   The kernel's cgroup interface is provided through a pseudo-filesystem called `cgroupfs`.


## cgroupv1 &amp; cgroupv2 {#cgroupv1-and-cgroupv2}

-   If `/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers` is present on your system, you are using v2, otherwise you are using v1.
