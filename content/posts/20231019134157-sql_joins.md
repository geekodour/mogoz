## Join Types in relational algebra {#join-types-in-relational-algebra}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231019134157-sql_joins-1035551454.png" >}}


### Cartesian Product {#cartesian-product}

-   See [Set Theory]({{< relref "20231019150045-set_theory.md" >}})
-   This translates to a `CROSS JOIN` (`CROSS JOIN` is **not** related to `Cross Product` from [Linear Algebra]({{< relref "20231019151731-linear_algebra.md" >}}))

### Theta Join {#theta-join}

-   Joins Horizontally
-   AKA `Qualified Join` (See [SQL join flavors](https://antonz.org/sql-join/))
-   Similar to `INTERSECTION` but allows different schema


### Natural Join {#natural-join}

-   Better than Cartesian Product in ways that gets rid of duplicates, adds filters etc.
-   A natural join finds all pairs of columns with the same name and uses them as join criteria.
-   we don't specify matching column names at all. Think of using `USING` but w/o even specifying the column name
-   Like Theta join, it can be inner, left, right, or full
-   Natural Join is a bad idea because of the implicit match. So mostly DB engines will be implementing Theta Joins.


### Lateral Join {#lateral-join}

![](/ox-hugo/20231019134157-sql_joins-1187616251.png)

-   This allows you to reference one subquery from another
-   More powerful than Parition Join, better supported
-   The `for each` loop of SQL


### Others {#others}

-   Semi Join
-   Anti Join
-   Equi Join
-   Self Join
-   Partition Join
    -   Only implemented by Oracle


### Client Side Join {#client-side-join}

-   This is not related to Relational Algebra
-   This is basically doing 2 regular query and then doing the join in the application code. Eg. If we need to join data from a mysql tables and a [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) table.


## Join Types in SQL {#join-types-in-sql}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231019134157-sql_joins-736425504.png" >}}

> -   Not all joins can be described though Venn diagrams, Venn diagrams do not give the full pictures of joins but they give good enough intuition
> -   There is no concept of `INNER(LEFT,RIGHT)` JOINs
>     -   LEFT OUTER  = LEFT
>     -   RIGHT OUTER = RIGHT
>     -   FULL OUTER  = FULL


### CROSS JOIN {#cross-join}

-   Is the Cartesian Product, Not related to `Cross Product` from [Linear Algebra]({{< relref "20231019151731-linear_algebra.md" >}}).
-   All other JOIN types can be derived from `CROSS JOIN`, with additional filters, and perhaps unions.


### INNER JOIN {#inner-join}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231019134157-sql_joins-1704137010.png" >}}

-   Commonly used
-   Inner join produces only the set of records that match in both Table A and Table B.


### OUTER JOIN {#outer-join}

Outer Joins are useful when we want to retain those rows from either the LEFT side or the RIGHT or both (FULL) sides


#### LEFT OUTER JOIN / LEFT JOIN {#left-outer-join-left-join}

![](/ox-hugo/20231019134157-sql_joins-1378521047.png)
![](/ox-hugo/20231019134157-sql_joins-1120119975.png)

-   Produces a complete set of records from Table A, with the matching records (where available) in Table B. If there is no match, the right side will contain null.
-   LEFT JOIN queries are among the most optimizable in every database server.


#### RIGHT OUTER JOIN / RIGHT JOIN {#right-outer-join-right-join}

-   right outer join behaves almost identically to the left outer join, but the roles of the tables are switched


#### FULL OUTER JOIN {#full-outer-join}

-   Combines the results of the left and right outer joins
-   Produces the set of all records in Table A and Table B, with matching records from both sides where available. If there is no match, the missing side will contain null.


## Join Syntax {#join-syntax}

-   TODO: Verify this

<!--listend-->

```sql
-- "Classic" ANSI JOIN syntax
SELECT *
FROM author a
JOIN book b ON a.author_id = b.author_id

-- "Nice" ANSI JOIN syntax
SELECT *
FROM author a
JOIN book b USING (author_id)
```


### Tips {#tips}

-   You can do multiple join in the same statement one after another
-   When writing JOIN statements, refer to columns as `table_name.column_name`
-   Atleast one of the joined columns should have an unique value, otherwise we can get strange results


## Join Complexity {#join-complexity}
