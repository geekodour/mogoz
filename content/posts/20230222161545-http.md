## 1.1,2,3 What? {#1-dot-1-2-3-what}

-   HTTP's "core" semantics donâ€™t change between protocol versions. i.e **most of the time** `methods` and `status codes`, `header fields` mean the same thing no matter what version of the protocol you use(HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3)


### HTTP/1.1 {#http-1-dot-1}

-   Written in 1997
-   RFC revised in 2013
-   RFC again revised in 2022
-   HTTP/1.1 suffers from **Head of line(HOL)** blocking. Each browser/client has a limited number of connections to a server and doing a new request over one of those connections has to wait for the ones to complete before it can fire it off.


### HTTP/2 {#http-2}

-   Prior to HTTP/2, WG attempted HTTP-NG2([Hypertext Transfer Protocol - Next Generation Overview](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP-NG/))
-   Introduced in 2015: [HTTP/2 For Web Developers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-2-for-web-developers/)
-   RFC revised in 2022
-   It addresses HOL by TCP multiplexing, but still have an underlying issue because `TCP` level
    -   Because TCP is reliable delivery protocol, Loss of a single packet in a flow can block access to those after it
    -   2021: [QUICv1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/quic-version-1-is-live-on-cloudflare/) was released to **replace** `TCP` . (QUIC uses UDP)
-   Added [Server Push]({{< relref "20230222180346-server_push.md" >}}): Servers can send `req/res pair` to clients in advance to make things faster
    -   Issue: Server predicting what the client needs is hard. Network conditions, client can have cache, over-pushing, conflict with real request for the same degrading performance
    -   Chrome ended up removing `server push` in 2022. Community says it's only suitable for certain usecases.
    -   [Early Hints](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc8297.html) as an alternative


### HTTP/3 {#http-3}

-   [HTTP/3](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-view-http3-usage/) is the version of HTTP that uses `QUIC` and does not suffer from HOLB.
-   Requires CA based TLS to set up a connection.


## Going Deeper {#going-deeper}


### Making a raw request {#making-a-raw-request}

```shell
# netcat usage to make a HTTP/1.1 req
$ printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: neverssl.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n' | nc neverssl.com 80

# NOTE: \r\n is known as CRLF(Carriage Return + Line Feed)
```


### Host field {#host-field}

> TODO: IDK what is the type of Host, what it is actually, i understadn what it does tho.

```shell
Host: neverssl.com
```

-   With this, we can now host different websites at the same IP address
-   But not all servers check it! So you can set `Host` and whether it gets used or not totally depends on the server.

> TODO: How is this different from SNI?

## Future areas of focus {#future-areas-of-focus}

These are areas where the WG is more active of recent


### Privacy {#privacy}

-   [MASQUE](https://ietf-wg-masque.github.io/) enabled UDP tunnels. This enhances HTTP.
-   MASQUE along with [IP Tunneling](https://blog.cloudflare.com/unlocking-quic-proxying-potential/) can possibly have us MASQUE VPN. Also check [OHTTP](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ohai-ohttp-06.html)


### Security {#security}

-   Replaces `digest` header <https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers.html>
-   Formalizes Message signatatures: <https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures.html>
-   Cookie spec revised: <https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html>


### Others ideas being explored {#others-ideas-being-explored}

-   HTTP over Websockets and Web Transport
-   QUERY (GET w body)
-   Resumable Uploads


## Keep hearing these terms, dn what {#keep-hearing-these-terms-dn-what}

-   Header and trailer fields
-   structured header fields


## Resources {#resources}
