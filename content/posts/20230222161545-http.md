## Meta {#meta}


### Connection vs Request {#connection-vs-request}


#### Connections {#connections}

-   client and server introduce themselves
-   HTTP1.1 and HTTP/2 uses TCP while HTTP/3 uses QUIC which is based on UDP.


#### Requests {#requests}

-   client ask something from server
-   To make a HTTP1.1 or HTTP2 request you need to have an active connection w the server.
-   Eg. An endpoint accepts 5 connections and 10 requests from given IP address.


### Browsers {#browsers}

-   Browsers usually limit 6 connections per origin(scheme, host, and port). Be it HTTP1.1 or HTTP2.


## 1.1,2,3 What? {#1-dot-1-2-3-what}

HTTP's "core" semantics don’t change between protocol versions. i.e **most of the time** `methods` and `status codes`, `header fields` mean the same thing no matter what version of the protocol you use(HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3)


### HTTP/1.1 {#http-1-dot-1}

-   Written in 1997
-   RFC revised in 2013
-   RFC again revised in 2022
-   HTTP/1.1 suffers from **Head of line(HOL)** blocking. Each browser/client has a limited number of connections to a server and doing a new request over one of those connections has to wait for the ones to complete before it can fire it off.
-   w HTTP1.1, browser can make `1 request/connection` but in-reality, they make multiple connections in parallel to the server. i.e `(new(r)/new(c)) x N`
-   Because of limited requests servers used to concat assets and do things like css sprites to reduce number of requests. But we don't have this issue w HTTP2 because no. of request is not a problem for HTTP2.
-   HTTP1.1 can still send multiple request in a connection using [pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining) but that's not widely supported and has other problems.
    -   Pipelining means sending further requests without waiting for responses.


#### HTTP Keep-Alive {#http-keep-alive}

-   This is also sometimes called `persistent connection` (`Connection: keep-alive`). This is default in HTTP1.1, so you don't really need to specify this.
-   HTTP Keep Alive allows `pipelining`, but keep-alive and pipeline are two different things. Like mentioned before pipelining is not widely supported.
    ![](/ox-hugo/20230222161545-http-1632876549.png)
-   [HTTP/2](#http-2) doesn't need this because it by design uses something that improves on this.
-   It allows us to use the **same** TCP `connection` for multiple HTTP `requests`. i.e `(new(r)/same(c)) x N`
-   As requests are joined by concat, we need to know where request starts and ends.
    -   Header section is always terminated by \r\n\r\n
    -   Specify `Content-Length` header
    -   OR Specify `Content-Encoding: chunked`, when streaming and length is not known.
-   Example from jamesfisher's blog
    ```bash
    cat <(printf "GET /status/200 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: httpbin.org\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n") \
          <(printf "GET /status/200 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: httpbin.org\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n") \
      | nc httpbin.org 80
    ```


### HTTP/2 {#http-2}

-   Prior to HTTP/2, WG attempted [HTTP_NG](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP-NG/)
-   [Introduced](https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-2-for-web-developers/) in 2015 and then RFC revised in 2022.
-   HTTP2 does the same thing as HTTP3/QUIC but on top of `TCP`
-   It introduced primarily 2 things, multplexing and server push thing. server push thing made john wick his enemy.


#### Multiplexing {#multiplexing}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230222161545-http-1777171190.png" >}}

-   HTTP2 adds multiplexing where we can make multiple `request` per `connection`. So no need to make multiple connections.
-   With this we do not delay sending of requests, no waiting for a free connection. All these requests make their way through the Internet to the server in (almost) parallel. The server responds to each one, and then they start to make their way back.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Dealing w HOL

    -   Web server can respond to them in any order it feels like and send back files in different order, or even break each file requested into pieces and intermingle the files together.
    -   This has the secondary benefit of one heavy request not blocking all the other subsequent requests i.e HOL.
    -   It addresses HOL by TCP multiplexing, but still have an underlying issue at `TCP` level. Because TCP is reliable delivery protocol, Loss of a single packet in a flow can block access to those after it. This happens often and seamlessly but HTTP3 makes this better w QUIC.
    -   Because of this, HTTP2's stream multiplexing works really well on good connections but terribly on bad.
    -   2021: [QUICv1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/quic-version-1-is-live-on-cloudflare/) was released to **replace** `TCP` . (QUIC uses UDP)


#### Ordering and Prioritization {#ordering-and-prioritization}

-   HTTP2 allows [request prioritization](https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-2-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/) for the client (browser)
-   But it is up to the server to decide what to do based on the request.
-   The server is free to not respect the prioritization request and process data at its own will.


#### Server Push GW {#server-push-gw}

-   Added [Server Push]({{< relref "20230222180346-server_push.md" >}}): Servers can send `req/res pair` to clients in advance to make things faster
-   Issue: Server predicting what the client needs is hard. Network conditions, client can have cache, over-pushing, conflict with real request for the same degrading performance
-   Chrome ended up removing `server push` in 2022. Community says it's only suitable for certain usecases. Has [Early Hints](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc8297.html) as an alternative.
-   [HTTP/2 Push is dead](https://evertpot.com/http-2-push-is-dead/) | [HTTP/2 upload speed](https://blog.cloudflare.com/delivering-http-2-upload-speed-improvements/) | [Why HTTP/2 is slower than HTTPS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33658302/why-http-2-is-slower-than-plain-https)


### HTTP/3 {#http-3}

-   HTTP/3 is `HTTP/2-Over-QUIC` by design (Analogy)
-   [HTTP/3](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-view-http3-usage/) is the version of HTTP that uses `QUIC` and does not suffer from HOLB.
-   Advantage of HTTP3 is that you only need to block the affected streams while retransmitting unlike HTTP2 where you need to block all streams.
-   Requires CA based TLS to set up a connection.


#### More on QUIC for HTTP3 {#more-on-quic-for-http3}

-   Idea of using UDP for QUIC is that, TCP's handshakes and acknowledges are redundant when you have it all anyway on L7, so they choose a simpler UDP as transport and re-implement handshakes and acknowledges in their applied protocols.
-   QUIC is over UDP for backwards compatibility, it was going to be its own protocol


## Headers {#headers}

-   Case does not matter


### Structured Header Fields {#structured-header-fields}

-   HTTP defines header values as a “sequence of octets” (i.e. bytes) with few constraints.
    -   Should be ASCII
    -   Should be defined in ABNF (Multiple fields with the same name can be combined on the same line if you separate their values with commas)
-   Structured header fields offer a better way. See [Improving HTTP with structured header fields | Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/blog/improve-http-structured-headers)


### Security Headers {#security-headers}

If your webserver does not allow you to set these headers, you can also use intermediaries [such as cloudflare to help you add these](https://algustionesa.com/security-headers/). Also see [Everything you need to know about HTTP security headers](https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html)

-   `Content-Security-Policy`
    -   See [CSP]({{< relref "20230616121539-xss.md#csp" >}}) for details
-   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS, See [TLS]({{< relref "20230210181907-tls.md" >}}))
-   `Public-Key-Pins` (HPKP)
    -   This is [deprecated now](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/1459ji1/where_are_we_with_certificatepublic_key_pinning/) in favor of things like [Certificate Transparency(CT)](https://certificate.transparency.dev/)
    -   Tries to solve for the case when two CA, issue certificate for the same domain, and could lead to MITM. who to trust?
-   `X-Frame-Options`
    -   Can have values `DENY`, `SAMEORIGIN` and `ALLOW-FROM <website_link>`
    -   See [Same Origin Policy (SOP)]({{< relref "20230616182504-same_origin_policy_sop.md" >}}) and [iframe]({{< relref "20230617111853-iframe.md" >}})
-   `X-Content-Type-Options`
    -   This solves `MIME sniffing`, `MIME sniffing` is a browser feature!
    -   Using `nosniff` disables browsers from trying to guess the content type of a document if for whatever reason it wasn't specified.
    -   So good practice to explicitly provide `Content-Type` header
    -   Attack example from chatgpt

        > Let's say you have a web page that allows users to upload images. However, an attacker might try to upload an image that is not actually an image file but instead a JavaScript file, pretending to be an image. Without the X-Content-Type-Options nosniff header, some browsers might try to interpret the file as a script and execute it, leading to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
-   `Referrer-Policy`
    -   Referrer policy defines the data that can be included in the `Referer` header. (Yes, `Referer` is a mis-spelling)
    -   `Referer` is a `request` specific header and is sent by the browser
    -   `Referrer-Policy` is a `response` header and is sent by the webserver
    -   Browsers will look at the `Referrer-Policy` and then decide what to send in the `Referer` header.
    -   Instead of specifying `Referrer-Policy` as part of the HTTP response, it can also be part of HTML
        -   `no-referrer` for meta tags
        -   `noreferrer` for [other tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy#integration_with_html)


### Other interesting headers {#other-interesting-headers}

-   `Content-Disposition`
    -   See [Content-Disposition - HTTP | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition)
    -   This controls whether the file is downloaded or shown inline in the browser
    -   This alternately can also be set in the `<a>` tag in HTML


### Range {#range}

-   Eg. Someone built a [sqlite]({{< relref "20230702184501-sqlite.md" >}}) VFS based on HTTP Range requests
-   Not compatible with HTTP Compression


## Features {#features}


### Compression {#compression}


### Caching {#caching}

See [Caching Tutorial for Web Authors and Webmasters](https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/)


#### Types {#types}

-   Browser/Private: The cache in your browser
-   Proxy: The cache your ISP uses
-   Gateway: CDNs/ [Reverse Proxies]({{< relref "20230212101521-proxies.md" >}})


#### State of representations(objects subject to cache) {#state-of-representations--objects-subject-to-cache}

The idea of `freshness` and `validity` are related, both are important for caching, if mechanism for `validity` is absent, there will be no caching!

<!--list-separator-->

-  Fresh

    -   can send to client w/o checking w `origin`
    -   `exp_time/age` within fresh period
    -   recently added to cache even if modified time was long ago
    -   Good cache systems will re-fetch data from origin when things change from `fresh` to `stale`, eg. `exp_time` passed and no user intervention.
    -   Based on certain headers, a cache may always `verify` with with `origin` regardless of other indicators of `freshness`. (Useful to assure that authentication is respected etc.)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Stale

    **Stale** (cache needs to ask `origin` to validate it)

    -   A cache will serve stale data if not able to verify with origin
    -   If stale data is validated by origin it'll be again considered fresh, else new actual fresh data will be put into the cache

<!--list-separator-->

-  Un-cachable

    -   If no `validator` exists. (Eg. `ETag` / `Last-Modified`)


#### Freshness related Headers {#freshness-related-headers}

|                 | Value                       | Freshness | Validity | Priority |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| `Cache-Control` | Multiple pre-defined values | X         | X        | 0 (most) |
| `Expires`       | Date(GMT)                   | X         |          | 1        |

-   `Expires`
    -   How long the associated representation is fresh for
    -   Clocks on the Web server and the cache must be synchronised for expected results
    -   We must not forget to update the value of `Expires` on the origin before it passes, otherwise request will be stale and will keep hitting origin forever.
    -   Caching static stuff, automatic periodic update of cache (also applies to `max-age` in cache-control headers)
    -   Can’t be circumvented; unless the cache runs out of room, the cached copy will be used until then! (only way out will be to purge cache somehow or change url)
-   `Cache-Control`
    -   Improves on `Expires` to give more control (Esp. `max-age`)
    -   Has multiple options that affect both `freshness` and when `validity` checks with origin are done. (Eg. `no-cache` + `public` is good for authenticated requests)
    -   `no-cache` means it'll verify on every req. i.e we still get cached data but it's ensured that it's fresh. `no-store` is absolutely skip the cache for everything.
    -   `must-revalidate` is like a flag for maintain `strict freshness`!
    -   Options
        ![](/ox-hugo/20230222161545-http-260119315.png)


#### Validation related Headers {#validation-related-headers}

|                 | Value         | Priority |
|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| `Etag`          |               | 0        |
| `Last-Modified` | DateTime(GMT) | 1        |

-   `Last-Modified`
    -   Eg. `curl -I --header 'If-Modified-Since: Tue, 11 Dec 2023 10:10:24 GMT' http://poop.com/faq/`
    -   Cache system can use a [If-Modified-Since](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since) to query for validation. `200` if new data, `304` if no change in data, i.e data in cache is still fresh.
    -   [If-Unmodified-Since](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Unmodified-Since) also works but its semantics and usage is somewhat different and works with `POST`
        -   Helps solve the "Lost Update Problem" where the last write may overwrite a previous write to a resource. (This is like poor man's [crdt]({{< relref "20230607045339-crdt.md" >}}) ?)
        -   Useful with `Range` requests, i.e to ensure we're fetching chunks from the same document.
-   `E-tag`
    -   Generated by the server and changed every time the representation does.
    -   Cache system can use a [If-None-Match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) to query for validation. `200` if new data, `304` if no change in data, i.e data in cache is still fresh.
    -   `E-tag` is weak comparison, i.e the actual content may have changed but if we don't update the etag properly, it'll still seem fresh from cache's side.
    -   Can be `e-tag` or `etag` in the header

## Going Deeper {#going-deeper}


### Making a raw request {#making-a-raw-request}

```shell
# netcat usage to make a HTTP/1.1 req
$ printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: neverssl.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n' | nc neverssl.com 80

# NOTE: \r\n is known as CRLF(Carriage Return + Line Feed)
```


### Host field {#host-field}

> TODO: IDK what is the type of Host, what it is actually, i understadn what it does tho.

```shell
Host: neverssl.com
```

-   With this, we can now host different websites at the same IP address
-   But not all servers check it! So you can set `Host` and whether it gets used or not totally depends on the server.
