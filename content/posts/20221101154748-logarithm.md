## Intro {#intro}

A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised in order to get some other number. Some references refer logarithm as an exponent. It can find the cause for an effect, i.e the **input for some output**.

John Napier introduced Logarithm as a means of simplifying calculations in 1614, that's about 400 years ago. It can do amazing and boring(?) things like counting zeros of a number(\\(log\_{10}(1000)=3\\)), extracting the fifth root of 27, list goes on. This page contains information mostly about real logs, there are [something called](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivalued_function) the [complex log aswell!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm) and there's [Discrete logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) which has uses in Cryptography.

#### A look into the definition {#a-look-into-the-definition}

-   If \\(x>0\\) and \\(b\in(0,\infin),\ b\ne1\\) then \\(y=log\_b(x)\\) iff \\(b^y=x\\)
-   In the equation \\(y=log\_b(x)\\), \\(y\\) is called the **logarithm.**
-   Logarithmic functions are only defined for positive real numbers.
-   The function \\(log\_b(x)\\) is [continuous](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1133697/how-do-i-prove-using-the-definition-that-the-logarithmic-function-is-continuous) for \\(x>0\\)

Proving that \\(x\\) needs to be positive is simple; If \\(x\\) were negative or 0, \\(b^y\\) has to result in a negative number or 0. No matter what \\(y\\) is, since \\(b\\) is a positive number it's [never going to be a negative number or 0.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuX7T4PM1Mc)

Now why does \\(b\\)(the base) has to be a positive real number not equal to 1?

\\(b^y=x\ \implies\ b^{log\_b(x)}=x\\)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Base 1

    -   For \\(x=5\\), \\(log\_1(5)\\) has no solution.
    -   For \\(x=1\\), \\(log\_1(1)\\) can be anything.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Base 0

    For \\(x=0\\), \\(log\_0(0)\\) can be anything, otherwise it does not have a solution. We also know that \\(x\\) can't be \\(0\\)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Base -2

    -   \\((-2)^2=4\\) \\(\implies\\) \\(log\_{-2}(4)=2=\frac{log\_2(4)}{log\_2(-2)}\implies log\_{2}(-2)=1\implies 2^1=-2\\) which is untrue.
    -   It's also because you can't take [even roots of negative numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root). Eg. \\((-2)^{1.01}=(-2)^{\frac{101}{100}}=\sqrt[100]{-2^{101}}\\) is not defined and we lose some properties such as continuity in the real plane.


## Bases {#bases}

In logarithm the value of a positive number depends not only on the number but also on the base of the logarithm. There are some well known bases.

-   Natural Log: \\(log\_e\\) written as ln
-   Common Log: \\(log\_{10}\\) written as lg
-   Binary Log: \\(log\_2\\) written as lb


### Natural Log {#natural-log}

The natural logarithm has the number e (that is b â‰ˆ 2.718) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and physics because it is immune to integration and differentiation.i.e. \\(\frac{d(e^x)}{dx}=e^x\\). Natural log is a continuous function.


### Common Log {#common-log}

The logarithm base 10 (that is b = 10) is called the common logarithm and has many applications in science and engineering.


#### Numbers greater than 1 (\\(x\\)) {#numbers-greater-than-1-x}

When it's about \\(lg\\) of numbers greater than 1 that differ by a factor of a power of 10 all have the same fractional part. This fractional part is called the `mantissa`; The integer part, called the `characteristic`

```python
>>> math.log10(3)
0.47712125471966244
>>> math.log10(30)
1.4771212547196624
>>> math.log10(300)
2.4771212547196626
```

> **\\(log\_{10}\\) and number of digits:**
>
> If \\(n\\) has \\(d\\) digits, then \\(10^{d-1}\leq n<10^{d}\\)
>
> \\(\implies d-1\leq log\_{10}(n)<d\\) \\((\because log\_{10}10^y=y)\\)
>
> \\(\lfloor{log\_{10}(n)}\rfloor = d-1\\) gives the integer part(the `characteristic`)
>
> \\(\implies \lfloor{log\_{10}(n)}\rfloor + 1 = d\\), total number of digits in \\(n\\)


#### Numbers greater than 0 but less than 1 {#numbers-greater-than-0-but-less-than-1}

Numbers greater than 0 and less than 1 have negative logarithms for the \\(log\_{10}\\) and other usual bases; but that's not true for something like \\(log\_{0.2}(0.8)\\)

### Binary Log {#binary-log}

The binary logarithm uses base 2 (that is b = 2) and is commonly used in computer science.


### Base does not matter? {#base-does-not-matter}

As far as big-Oh notation is concerned, the base of the logarithms doesn't make any real difference, because of **Change of Base** property and logarithms are related by some constant. So it's common to see just \\(log(x)\\) notation in big-Oh as the base does not matter.
