## Lossless vs Lossy {#lossless-vs-lossy}

This is not specific to images and what these mean can differ from medium to medium(eg. music vs image)


### Lossy {#lossy}

-   With music MP3 actually throws out parts of the music people typically can't hear. That part is gone forever.


### Lossless {#lossless}

-   Lossless compression is like you taking a ball, and letting the air out.
-   You can put air back in and it's the same ball.
-   You just look for patterns of 1's and 0's A's replace them with something shorter.


## Resources {#resources}

-   Listen to the corecursive podcast w zstd creator. It's amazing.
