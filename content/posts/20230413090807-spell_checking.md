## Some History {#some-history}


### Spellcheckers {#spellcheckers}

These are usually based in their dictionary formats and how well they support certain language construction. Some languages allow really strange things that simple word dictionaries don't cut it.

-   `ispell` : "original" spellchecker from GNU, very old. (Before unicode, needs special treatment w utf-8)
-   `aspell` : Improves ispell w better unicode support
-   `myspell` : This was created for open-office. (unicode support + multiple languages)
-   `hunspell` : Originally developed for hungarian, based on `myspell`, later replaced `myspell`
