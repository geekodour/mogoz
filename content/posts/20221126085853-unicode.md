The agreement between the two computers about the correspondence between letters and numbers is what Unicode standardizes.

> In terms of Unicode, `h` is:
>
> -   An `abstract character` named `LATIN SMALL LETTER H`.
> -   This `character` has the corresponding `number 0x68`
> -   Which is a `code point` in notation `U+0068`.

-   The first Unicode version 1.0 was published in October 1991 and had 7,161 characters "associated". The latest version provides codes for 149,186 characters "associated".
-   Total characters: 2<sup>16</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> - 2<sup>11</sup> = 1,112,064(~1mn) assignable code points.
    -   2<sup>16</sup> : Plane 0 (BMP) (`U+0000` - `U+FFFF`)
    -   2<sup>20</sup> : Plane 1-16 (astral planes/supplementary planes) (`U+10000` - `U+10FFFF`)
    -   2<sup>11</sup> : Code points from `U+D800` - `U+DFFF` which are used to encode surrogate pairs in `UTF-16`


## Codespace and blocks {#codespace-and-blocks}

-   The Unicode `codespace` is divided into 17 `planes`, numbered 0 to 16.
-   The Unicode Standard defines a `codespace` (a set of numerical values ranging from 0 through 10FFFF) called `code points` and denoted as `U+0000` through `U+10FFFF` (See [blocks.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/Blocks.txt) )
-   Plane 0 is the `Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)`
    -   Single code unit in `UTF-16` encoding
    -   Encoded in 1, 2 or 3 bytes in `UTF-8`.
-   Planes 1 through 16 are supplementary planes
    -   Accessed as surrogate pairs in `UTF-16`
    -   Encoded in four bytes in `UTF-8`
-   Within each `plane`, characters are allocated within named `blocks` of related characters.
    -   Characters required for a given script may be spread out over several different blocks.


## Code units {#code-units}

How unicode is interpreted by the computer: `code units`

> Code unit is a bit sequence used to encode each character within a given encoding form.

-   The `character encoding` is what transforms abstract code points into physical bits: code units.
-   Popular encodings are `UTF-8`, `UTF-16` and `UTF-32` (UTF = Unicode Transformation Format)


## Encodings {#encodings}

### UTF-16 {#utf-16}

-   Windows tends to use UTF-16
-   It uses 16 bit code units (16 bits = 2 bytes).
-   variable-length encoding
-   Surrogate pairs are a UTF-16 thing.
    -   The main hazard of UTF-16 is that it leads to people believing they are handling unicode correctly, when often they don't properly decode surrogate pairs, etc.
    -   Surrogate pair is a representation for a single abstract character that consists of a sequence of code units of two 16-bit code units, where the first value of the pair is a high-surrogate code unit and the second value is a low-surrogate code unit.
-   Code points
    -   Code points from BMP are encoded using a single code unit of 16-bit
    -   Code points from astral planes are encoded using two code units of 16-bit each(U+D800 - U+DFFF). (surrogate pairs) This allows encoding of over one million additional characters.
        -   High surrogate: Unicode code point from range U+D800 to U+DBFF  gets combined with another unicode code point
        -   Low surrogate: Unicode code point from range U+DC00 to U+DFFF to generate a whole new character


### UTF-32 {#utf-32}

-   It uses 32 bit code units (32 bits = 4 bytes).
-   An encoding where "all characters [are] matched with just one code point", and it's UTF-32.
-   Pros
    -   character is the same length. (fixed length encoding). So you know right away where you can split it without cutting any letters in half.
-   Cons
    -   Takes too much space. i.e downloading that text takes four times as long compared to UTF-8.


### UTF-8 {#utf-8}

-   Mac OS X and Linux use UTF-8.
-   variable-length encoding
-   It uses 8 bit code units (8 bits = 1 byte).
-   It uses sequences of `up to four code units` to encode one `code point`.
-   Pros
    -   UTF-8 has the advantage that it uses the least amount of space if your characters are mostly in the basic Latin alphabet and punctuation. Webpages use UTF-8 because of this.
-   Cons
    -   If you want to split the text into pieces, you have to be careful not to break up the text in the middle of a character.
    -   It's also not possible to find the 100th character without going through the first 99 (since they could be different lengths).


## Language usage {#language-usage}


### [Javascript]({{< relref "20221126085225-javascript.md" >}}) {#javascript--20221126085225-javascript-dot-md}

-   `Strings` are represented fundamentally as sequences of `UTF-16` code units.
-   every code unit is exact 16 bits long. (maximum of 2<sup>16</sup>, or `65,536` possible characters)
-   This character set is called the basic multilingual plane (BMP)
-   To avoid ambiguity, the two parts of the pair must be between `0xD800` and `0xDFFF`, and these code units are not used to encode single-code-unit characters.
    -   `split` by UTF-16 code units and will separate surrogate pairs.
-   Surrogate pairs, combining marks and grapheme are tough to handle in JavaScript.
-   Where ECMAScript operations interpret String values, each element is interpreted as a single UTF-16 code unit. i.e The length of a String is the number of elements. always think of string in JavaScript as a sequence of code units.
-   **Most of the JavaScript string methods are not Unicode-aware.**
-   [What every JavaScript developer should know about Unicode](https://dmitripavlutin.com/what-every-javascript-developer-should-know-about-unicode/)

> -   Every element of a string is interpreted by the engine as a code unit.
> -   The way a string is rendered does not provide a deterministic way to decide what code units (that represent code points) it contains.

```javascript
console.log('cafe\u0301'); // => 'café'
console.log('café');       // => 'café'
// 'cafe\u0301' and 'café' literals have slightly different code units,
// but both are rendered the same sequence of symbols café.
```


#### Escape sequences {#escape-sequences}

Escape sequences in strings are used to express code units based on code point numbers.

-   Hexadecimal escape sequence
-   Unicode escape sequence
-   Code point escape sequence(new)
