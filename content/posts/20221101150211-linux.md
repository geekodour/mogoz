## Nvidia and Linux {#nvidia-and-linux}


### MXM {#mxm}

-   MXM support shows as VGA Controller in lspci (dedicated graphics)
    -   This easy, we can run standalone
-   MXM non-support shows as 3D Controller in lspci (laptops)
    -   We need to use [Nvidia Optimus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Optimus)
    -   Current solution: Nvidia PRIME
    -   Previous solution: Bumblebee (now deprecated)


### Drivers {#drivers}

-   opensource &amp; prop.


## Nix {#nix}


### NixOS {#nixos}

-   NixOS does away with FHS with nix-store
    -   nix-store output = hash of recipie + package name + package version
    -   This allows nix-store
        -   to have different versions of the same software package
        -   to have same version but compiled with different flags aswell!
-   Has some FHS stuff to keep things posix compliant, eg `/bin/sh`, `/usr/bin/env`, all other stuff goes into `/nix/store` and everything else gets symlinked from `/run/current-system`


#### Module system {#module-system}

#### Tools {#tools}

-   `nixos-option services.interception-tools.plugins` to dig down on options available
-   home manager options: <https://mipmip.github.io/home-manager-option-search/?query=keychain>


### Package manager usage {#package-manager-usage}

#### nix-env {#nix-env}

-   `nix-env` tool manages environments, profiles and their generations.
-   `nix-env -i` installs stuff
-   Using this is an **anti-pattern**, we go back to what we had before in non nixos. One global package for everything.


#### nix-shell {#nix-shell}

-   It only provides a bash shell, but that's mostly all you need.
-   Ephemeral
    -   This allows us to do shit like `nix-shell -p go1.16 -p nodejs23` and then `nix-shell -p go1.20 -p ruby3` and it'll just spin up those environments for us without polluting them in the global namespace.
-   Reusable environments
    -   This is nice, picks shell.nix / default.nix from current directory
    -   Same idea of ephemeral but now into a file and now can be re-produced anywhere
