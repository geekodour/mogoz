## Syntax {#syntax}

-   `%coolgroup HOST=(user1:group1) commands_allowed_set1, (user2:group4) commands_allowed_set2`
    -   = : RHS(user/group+hostnames), LHS(target user/group+command list)
        -   RHS
            -   `%coolgroup` : The user/group. `%` prefix for groups.
            -   `HOST` : List of hostnames on which this sudo entry will be effective. Usually, (localhost) so this field is usually left as `ALL`.
        -   LHS
            -   This can be comma separated list, usually it's just one set. Explanation for the first pair in the list.
            -   `(user1:group1)`: Specifies which users (and groups) `coolgroup` will be able to run the commands as.
            -   `commands_allowed_set1` : List of commands(comma separated) `coolgroup` will be able to run with elevated privileges.
    -   Examples
        -   `%coolgroup ALL=(ALL) ALL`
            -   LHS
                -   `(ALL)` : `%coolgroup` will only be able to run as all users. Not groups. `sudo` cannot be used with `-g` by that user for the commands.
                -   `ALL` : All commands are allowed.
        -   `%coolgroup ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
            -   LHS
                -   `(ALL:ALL)` : `%coolgroup` will only be able to run as all users and all groups.
                -   `ALL` : All commands are allowed.
