## LXC {#lxc}

-   LXC Images : [Linux Containers - Image server](https://uk.lxd.images.canonical.com/)
-   OS level virtualization for running multiple isolated containers on single Linux kernel.
-   Introduced 2008
-   Lowlevel
-   Usually managed via manager like LXD
-   LXC is because it doesn't support OCI.


## LXD {#lxd}


### Intro {#intro}

-   LXD is built on top of LXC and aims to provide a better user experience. Basically a management system on top of LXC.
-   It implements a single REST API for both local and remote access.
-   Scales from one instance on a single machine to a cluster in a full data center rack

LXD consists of two parts:

-   Daemon (the `lxd` binary)
-   Client (the `lxc` binary)


### Confusion w LXC {#confusion-w-lxc}

<div class="warning small-text">

> `lxc` is not `LXC`; the naming is a bit confusing.
>
> -   `lxc` is the `lxd` client
> -   All `lxc-*` commands are low level LXC commands
</div>


### Setting up LXD {#setting-up-lxd}

-   Daemon
    -   Anyone belonging to the `lxd` group will have access to the daemon.
    -   LXD daemon can be accessed locally over a Unix socket or, if configured, remotely over a TLS socket.
-   User
    -   LXD loads the subuid/subgid values from /etc on startup.
-   Config &amp; Profile
    -   Everytime you `lxd init`, config gets overwritten, you can use `--preseed` to provide config via file.
    -   For the bare minimum, you need to set a storage pool and network bridge.
    -   Once the network bridge is setup, it'll show up in `ip addr`
    -   See [Instance options - LXD documentation](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/master/reference/instance_options/#instance-options-security)
-   Net NS
    -   Once containers are started namespaces can be listed using
        ```nil
          ip netns list-id
        ```


### Instances {#instances}


#### Containers {#containers}

Implemented through the use of `liblxc` (LXC).

-   System container
    -   Simulates a virtual version of a full operating system.
    -   Uses kernel running on the host system.
    -   Suitable for full solution of libraries, applications, databases etc.
    -   Can create different user spaces and isolate all processes belonging to each user space
-   Application container
    -   These are more in the likes of what Docker provides
    -   Usually packages a single process or application.
    -   Suitable to provide separate components


#### VMs {#vms}

-   Uses `qemu` to provide the VM functionality.
-   Uses the hardware of the host system
-   Uses kernel provided by the virtual machine.
-   Can be used to run a different operating system.


#### Configuration {#configuration}

-   Instance properties
-   Instance options
-   Instance devices


### Privileged and Unprivileged containers {#privileged-and-unprivileged-containers}


#### How does LXD do unprivileged {#how-does-lxd-do-unprivileged}

-   LXD by default is unprivileged
-   Default map: 65536 UIDs and GIDs, w host base id of 100000.
-   container `root` (`uid0`) : mapped to host uid 100000
-   container (`uid65535`) : mapped to host uid 165535


#### `subuid` and `subgid` {#subuid-and-subgid}

See [subuid and subgid subordinate(uids/gids)]({{< relref "20230218104617-containers.md#subuid-and-subgid-subordinate--uids-gids" >}}) for details.
LXD allows updating of these via `security.idmap.isolated`, `security.idmap.size` , `security.idmap.base` and `raw.idmap`. Read [Idmaps for user namespace](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/master/userns-idmap/) for more details.

-   Change the size of the default map
-   Per container maps
    ```shell
    lxc config set <instance> security.idmap.isolated true # no sharing btwn containers
    lxc config set <instance> security.idmap.size 200000 # change alloc size
    # if allocation > allocated to lxd itself, will throw error
    ```
-   Access host but not other containers. In unprivileged containers, usually user will be mapped to a user that doesn't exist on `host` = no storage sharing w host


### Personal config and setup {#personal-config-and-setup}


#### Install LXC {#install-lxc}

This file is automatically created and populated once LXC is installed.

```shell
λ cat /etc/lxc/default.conf
lxc.net.0.type = veth
lxc.net.0.link = lxcbr0
lxc.net.0.flags = up
lxc.net.0.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:xx:xx:xx
```


#### Install LXD {#install-lxd}

-   The only entries that matter to LXD are the ones for the `root` user.
-   LXD itself is restricted by the `root` allocation. One may [sometimes see](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/how-exactly-should-i-map-uid-gid-for-lxd-non-snap/13767/5) `lxd` user in these files, they are there just to ease tracking by the sysadmin.
-   A user can have multiple allocations.

<!--listend-->

```shell
λ sudo usermod -v 1000000-1000999999 -w 1000000-1000999999 root
λ cat /etc/sub{u,g}id
root:1000000:1000000000
root:1000000:1000000000
```


#### Make LXD accessible {#make-lxd-accessible}

-   See [About security - LXD documentation](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/master/explanation/security/#access-to-the-lxd-daemon)
-   `lxc` (the LXC client) needs to communicate to the `lxd` daemon via unix socket
-   Access control for LXD daemon is possible only locally via group membership. If anything else, you need to expose LXD over the network.

<!--listend-->

```shell
usermod -a -G lxd geekodour
```


#### Sharing folder {#sharing-folder}

There are couple of cases here. They use the `shift` method. ~~For readonly none of this is needed.~~

```shell
$ lxc info | grep -E 'idmapped|shiftfs'
idmapped_mounts: "true" # kernel feature
shiftfs: "false"
idmapped_mounts_v2: "true" # lxc feature
```

If this is enabled, you're good to go.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Mounting host directory to instance

    -   Add disk
        ```text
        $ lxc config device add <instance_name> <device_name> disk source=/home/geekodour/some_dir path=/home/ubuntu/dir_inside_container
        ```
    -   Allow LXD to be able to map the uid of user(eg. `1000`) inside of containers. i.e Add `root:1000:1` to `subuid` and `subgid` files.
    -   Once this is done, `idmap` has to be setup to make use of that host uid `1000`

    <div class="warning small-text">

    > Adding a idmap to an actual user allows the container to run actual processes as that user which means it can use `ulimit` to apply system-wide restrictions to the uid and potentially impacting processes in other containers or even on the host.

-  Access files

    There are [other methods to access files](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/latest/howto/instances_access_files/) that I've to explore.


### LXD Profiles {#lxd-profiles}

-   The configuration hierarchy is as follows: `on the instance > certain ordered profile > default profile`
    -   Instance options: array under `config`.
    -   Instance devices: under `devices`.
-   `Devices` from `profiles` are applied to the `instance` in the order in which the `profiles` are assigned to the `instance`.
-   `Devices` defined directly in the instance configuration are applied last.
-   At each stage, if a `device` with the same name already exists from an earlier stage, the whole `device` entry is overridden by the latest definition.


### Storage {#storage}


#### Jargon {#jargon}

-   Storage pool = disk to store data (LXD stores its data in storage pools)
-   Storage volume = Different partitions used for specific purposes
-   Storage buckets = Uses the Amazon S3 protocol.


#### Storage pool {#storage-pool}

-   When you first setup LXD, you assign some space for all the containers. This space is called a `storage pool`.
-   Storage pool = Multiple storage volumes of different content type(images/instances) + Storage buckets
-   Storage pool needs a `storage driver`. One of dir, btrfs, lvm, zfs, ceph-X
-   In a `profile`, the `storage pool` to use is defined by the pool for the `root` disk device


#### Storage location {#storage-location}

<div class="warning small-text">

> When using `dir`, the reported usage by the kernel would be that of the entire partition.
>
> These 3 will be same:
>
> -   `df -h` / on the host
> -   `df -h` / in any of the containers
> -   `lxc storage info default`
</div>

-   We have `4` options here: Shared with the host, Dedicated disk or partition, Loop disk, Remote storage
-   For my usecase it's Shared with the host with `dir` storage driver


#### Storage volume {#storage-volume}

-   There is no concept of a default storage pool in LXD. When you create a storage volume, you must specify the storage pool to use.
-   `3` types
    -   `container/vm`
        -   Auto created at instance creation at storage pool specified by instance/profile/default profile
        -   Used as the root disk for the instance
        -   Destroyed when the instance is deleted.
    -   `image`
        -   Only for `storage drivers` that support optimized image storage.
        -   If deleted manually, auto deleted after ten days after last used to launch an instance.
    -   `custom`
        -   Volumes to hold data that you want to store separately from your instances.
        -   Can be shared between instances
        -   Has to be manually deleted
-   `2` content types: `filesystem` (container and vms) and `block` (vm only)

## Container nesting {#container-nesting}

You can run docker inside LXD by setting `security.nesting`
