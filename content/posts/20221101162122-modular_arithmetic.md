> `100mod8 = r`: 8 is called the modulus, `r` be +ve no. Sometimes, we are only interested in what the remainder is when we divide A by B. For these cases there is an operator called the modulo operator (abbreviated as mod).

-   `100mod8` = `100%8` = `100/8 ka remainder` = `100 - (8*12)` = 4
-   `-100mod8` = `-100%8` = `8 - (100/8 ka remainder)` = `-100 - (8*(-13))` = 4
