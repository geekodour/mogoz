## Personal Ideas {#personal-ideas}

-   We should teach that, it is our duty to the next generation to teach them to learn, to read and to write because that's what makes humans special, that's how we can go forward into the future. without science, we'd still be using stones to light fire.
-   We should also teach that helping the less privileged is our duty. Teach them kindness, humbleness, and all the other human values. Not like as subjects but with properly researched pedagogical views that help the students absorb it, immersive learning of human values.
-   Biggest barrier for children â†’ adults around them, Adults understand things better so they should understand children.
-   Like Marc Andreessen talks about living in the future, students should ****not**** be bought up in the past but in the present or in the future. Eg. GIMT Guwahati is bringing up students in the past. This is a reality/heartbeat check that education providers should do with themselves to keep themselves relevant.
-   Solving the problem of education is like defeating a huge monster 100s of magnitude bigger, at this point, I am confused where do I start if I want to defeat it or even make a dent on it.
-   Apply the **thikadar/contractor** idea to education, the private organization takes up the responsibility to improve certain sections of society.  Example: Through their grant, the Pittsburgh Community Kitchen will provide culinary training and sustainable employment opportunities for 100 people transitioning into the workforce from incarceration, homelessness, addiction, or mental illness.
-   The digital natives might not have digital literacy.
-   The Chinese restaurant model versus McDonald's model. One spreads and the other one scales. Anyone can create a Chinese restaurant but not anyone can open a McDonalds. We need to do the Chinese restaurant for education. Eg. Montessori.
-   When reforming education we must keep two things in mind:
    -   ****Economic****: how do we educate students to survive the 21st century
    -   ****Cultural****: being part of the global thing as well as teach our own culture
-   Past was about delivered education, now we need to think about user generated wisdom.
