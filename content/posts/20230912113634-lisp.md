## What? {#what}

-   It's not a specific language. It's a family of programming languages characterised by the fact that all their computation is represented by lists. Clojure, Scheme, [Racket]({{< relref "20230511000748-racket.md" >}}), elisp, Common Lisp are some examples
-   You can define your own LISP


### Homoiconicity {#homoiconicity}

Lisp is homoiconic, which means that code and data share the same structure. Lisp macros operate on the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the code, which is essentially a data structure representing the code itself.


## Ideas/Concepts {#ideas-concepts}


### S-Expression {#s-expression}

-   Symbolic Expression
-   A internal list structure that is built up recursively of numbers, symbols, and other lists
