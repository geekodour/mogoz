#### Alan Resources {#alan-resources}

Alan mentions all the books in the talks and shows the front page. Sorry, it takes to much time right now to order, edit and prioritise the list of books for you. I'll try to append that to this thread later this week. You can contact me on morphle at ziggo dot nl and we can have an interactive session where I can shower you with critical thinking resources from Alan Kay, Marvin Minksy and a few others.

Book references:

Human Blindspots and “Bad Brains”:

Francis Bacon, “Novum Organum Scientia”

Daniel Kanneman, “Thinking: Fast and Slow”

Robert Meyer, Howard Kunreuthner, “The Ostrich Paradox”

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases>

Alfred Korzybski, “Science and Sanity”

YouTube: “How To Catch A Baboon” <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctol7JwpcuQ>

Exemplary Practices and Perspectives:

Amory Lovins, “Reinventing Fire”

E.F. Schumaker, “Small Is Beautiful”

Christopher Alexander, “Notes on the Synthesis of Form”

from: <http://www.vpri.org/pdf/Kay_How.pdf>

<https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/alan-kay-books>

<https://wiki.c2.com/?AlanKaysReadingList>

<https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/alan-kay-books>

I know there must be lots more if you search online, there is even a HN post with a book list written by Alan himself.

I have gathered the books on these lists and all the video's of the talks in a 500 GB torrent. Maybe you can help organise it so we can publish it here?

### Timeline {#timeline}


#### 6:30-7PM: Start making CT&amp;DT PPT {#6-30-7pm-start-making-ct-and-dt-ppt}


#### 7PM-730PM: Finish CT&amp;DT PPT {#7pm-730pm-finish-ct-and-dt-ppt}


#### 8PM: Start {#8pm-start}


### Meta {#meta}


#### On LSF execution {#on-lsf-execution}

-   Pause in between sections
-   Do polls/activities
    -   Age distribution etc.
-   Make sure they understand the zoom etiquette
-   Set right expectations to students at the start
    -   They're are just expected to listen and understand at this point
-   Have a running document, so that if anyone joins in the middle they'd have context


### Programming 101 {#programming-101}


#### What are computers {#what-are-computers}

-   Discuss computers. All kids started talking about laptops of their parents (
-   here are many computers in different places – like smartphones or watches, but also in cars and lifts.


#### Should you learn to code? {#should-you-learn-to-code}

-   Basic math: 12\*3 = 36, useful when doin shopping
-   Reading: Allows us to absorb an incredible amount of knowledge,
-   Writing: Allows us to express our ideas.
-   Bike riding?
-   Code?
-   Proxy to problem solving


#### Activities {#activities}

-   Who knows what a programmer does?


#### What to focus on? {#what-to-focus-on}

-   TLDR: Focus on getting them to have fun &amp; enjoy learning about 'code'. Don't care so much on how well they learn it.
-   Show them how to "hack" Google with the browser's dev inspector tools.
-   Give them simple partially completed programs that they can modify. Rather than giving them code to write from scratch.
-   finding the joy in programming should be your number one goal. Having peers to bounce off of and push each other forward is a great way to do this!


### Computational thinking {#computational-thinking}


#### Activities {#activities}

-   Bootstrapworld
-   Have you thought how you think.
-   Hacking your brain
-   What's your first memory?
-   Can you multitask?

    > Multitasking, in short, is not only not thinking, it impairs your ability to
    > think.
    >
    > Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it. Not learning other people’s ideas, or memorizing a body of information, however much those may sometimes be useful.
    >
    > Developing your own
    > ideas. In short, thinking for yourself.


#### Different kinds of thinking? {#different-kinds-of-thinking}

-   How does CT applies to other areas?
-   Design thinking
    -   A bit more oriented toward out of the box idea generation
    -   Secondary focus on using research to inform what and how ideas are implemented.
-   Computational thinking
    -   <https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/20d79k/iwtl_computational_thinking/>
-   FP thinking easy to misuse and make it into philosophical thinking.
-   Creative thinking
    -   <http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~naderi/Claude%20Shannon.html>
-   Heuristics / Mental models
    -   Eg. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy>


#### How is this different from computer science? {#how-is-this-different-from-computer-science}


#### Teaching {#teaching}

-   Students to come up with their own analogies


#### Problem solving {#problem-solving}

<!--list-separator-->

-  CH

    1.  Reduce the problem to its most essential parts
    2.  Find related problems that have already been solved
    3.  Restate the problem in as many different ways as possible
    4.  Generalize a solution to as many problems as possible. See where it can apply again.
    5.  Break large gaps between a problem and solution by solving a bunch of smaller problems (sometimes even in a roundabout way) and gradually piece yourself bit by bit towards the solution.
    6.  Invert the problem and solution
