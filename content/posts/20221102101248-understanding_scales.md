## Decimal Separator {#decimal-separator}

One thing that ate my head initially was that some people use `.` [as decimal separator. why bro?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator)


## million, billion, lakh, cr {#million-billion-lakh-cr}

-   1bn = 100cr = 9 zeros = \\(10^9\\)
-   1cr = 10mn = 100lac = 7 zeros = \\(10^7\\)
-   1mn = 10lac = 6 zeros = \\(10^6\\)
-   1lac = \\(10^5\\)

> For currency it's again multiplying by the currency. Eg. To me a millionaire you'll need:
>
> \\(75.69 \times 10^6 \approx 7\*10^7\\), so if you have around `₹ 7cr` in your bank, you're a millionaire. 🤑

## bandwidth, latency and throughput {#bandwidth-latency-and-throughput}

Layman explanation don't ?? (????) me; You live in Guwahati and wish to send `200TiB` of pirated ebooks to your friend in Delhi, out of may options here are two:

-   Send it via mailpost (`High Bandwidth`, `High Latency`)
-   Send it via IP Network/Internet (`Low Bandwidth`, `Low Latency`)

It'll take a lot of time for your friend to download `200TiB` of data with the Internet but will be able to stream it the fastest due to lower latency than sending it via mailpost.

-   **Bandwidth**: Amount of data you can send. **High Bandwidth is good.**
-   **Latency**: How much time it takes for a signal(in our case the first signal) to travel to its destination. **Low Latency is good.**
-   **Throughput**: How much data is travelling. **High Throughput is good.**

## Bytes {#bytes}

-   1e+9 bytes = 1e9 = \\(10^9\\)B = 2^30B = 1GB (1 Billion bytes in 1GB)
-   1e+6 bytes = 1e6 = \\(10^6\\)B = 2^20B = 1MB (1 Million bytes in 1MB)
-   8bits = 1byte \\(\implies\\) 500KB = 4000Kb = 4Mb
-   12Mbps connection = 1.5MBps (network uses bps)

> The reason you choose one scale over another when graphing is to reveal detail that might otherwise be hidden by the nature of the data you're looking at.


### Signed &amp; Unsigned integers {#signed-and-unsigned-integers}

There are arch dependent integer types such as `int`, `uint` these pick the length based on arch. Eg. on 64bit systems, `int` will be `int64`, `uint` will be `uint64`


#### Signed integers {#signed-integers}

-   int8: -1&lt;&lt;2<sup>3</sup>-1 to 1&lt;&lt;(2<sup>3</sup>-1)-1 : -128 to 127
-   int16: -1&lt;&lt;2<sup>4</sup>-1 to 1&lt;&lt;(2<sup>4</sup>-1)-1 : -32768 to 32767
-   int32: -1&lt;&lt;2<sup>5</sup>-1 to 1&lt;&lt;(2<sup>5</sup>-1)-1 : -2147483648 to 2147483647
-   int64: -1&lt;&lt;2<sup>6</sup>-1 to 1&lt;&lt;(2<sup>6</sup>-1)-1 : -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807


#### Unsigned integers {#unsigned-integers}

-   uint8: 0 to 1&lt;&lt;2<sup>3</sup>-1 : 0 to 255
-   uint16: 0 to 1&lt;&lt;2<sup>4</sup>-1 : 0 to 65535
-   uint32: 0 to 1&lt;&lt;2<sup>5</sup>-1 : 0 to 4294967295
-   uint64: 0 to 1&lt;&lt;2<sup>6</sup>-1 : 0 to 18446744073709551615


## Log scales {#log-scales}

See [Logarithm]({{< relref "20221101154748-logarithm.md" >}})

> {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/logscale.png" >}}

> _The distance from 1 to 2 is the same as the distance from 2 to 4, or from 4 to 8. Similarly 1 to 3 is the same as 3 to 9 and 10 to 100 is the same distance as 1 to 10. Thus moving a set distance along the scale means the number has been multiplied by 10 (or some other fixed factor) ;_

A scale of measurement where the position is marked using the logarithm of a value instead of the actual value. Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes.

Suppose you have the inputs, which have a **lot of variation:**

```text
1, 3, 5134573435345, 0.0000000053453
```

Taking \\(log\_{10}\\) of these numbers we get:

```text
0, 0.477, 12.7, -8.27
```

which seem plottable and easily comparable. The statement _"A speck of dust is half way between the size of an atom and the planet earth if you're using logarethmic scale."_ makes sense now.

Some measurements vary by a little at the small scale, or a lot at the large scale. Log scale is simply more convenient than a linear scale for these measurements. Richter Scale, concentration of ions (pH-scale), anything that involves our senses (f-stops in photography, decibels, octaves), entropy, star brightness etc. Some of these use \\(log\_{10}\\) and some use \\(log\_2\\)

### Few funny things to care about {#few-funny-things-to-care-about}

-   There is no such thing called the exponential scale.
-   Often exponential growth curves are displayed on a log scale.
-   lin/linear scale is additive, while the log scale is multiplicative by a fixed number.

## Growth {#growth}

> This section probably has a lot of mistakes!
>
> -   [OEIS Wiki Page on Growth Sequences](https://oeis.org/wiki/Growth_of_sequences)

Growth refers to how fast a sequence of numbers increase. Sometimes decay is used to mean the opposite. Before we get more into growth, Let's see the concept of **bound**. We say B bounds A (above) if B grows faster than A, that is, at some point B becomes bigger than A and stays bigger forever (the same apply for bounded below). **To look at growth, we look at the derivatives.**

Among other growth sequences, the most common are growth sequences that we see in the news are **Linear &lt; Polynomial &lt; Exponential**

> These growths are related to respective functions, So let \\(t\\) be a variable signifying something like `time`, and let \\(f(t)\\) be some kind of function of \\(t\\). (Informal defs., see wikipedia for formal defs.)


### Linear Growth {#linear-growth}

> \\(f\\) grows linearly if eventually, \\(f(t) = t\\)

Linear is a kind of polynomial, specifically of degree 1. Linear growth is the one most people will be familiar with, as it is everywhere in our daily life.


### Exponential Growth {#exponential-growth}

> \\(f\\) grows exponentially if eventually, \\(f(t) = e^{at}\\) for some constant \\(a > 0\\).

**Other names**: Proportional growth, Geometric growth(in the discrete domain)

Exponential growth refers to a pattern of growth that the rate of increase is proportional to its current value.


### Polynomial Growth {#polynomial-growth}

A polynomial function does not grow exponentially. An exponential function does grow exponentially. Quadratical, Cubic, Quartic,etc fall under this.


### Logarithmic Growth {#logarithmic-growth}

> \\(f\\) grows logarithmically if eventually, \\(f(t) = log(t)\\).

Logarithmic growth is the inverse of exponential growth and is very slow. Basically think of it like this:

-   Growing from 0-10 is fastest
-   Growing from 10-100 is faster
-   Growing from 100-1000 is fast
-   Growing from 1000-10,000 is can be slow
-   Growing from 10000-100000 is can be slower
-   Growing from 100000-1mn is can be slowest
-   and so on.

## Order of Magnitude {#order-of-magnitude}

An **order of magnitude** is an approximate [position on a **logarithmic scale.**](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude). Eg. \\(4\times10^6\\) has a common logarithm of `~6.602`; Its order of magnitude is `6`.


## Inclusive and Exclusive {#inclusive-and-exclusive}

-   [ : Inclusive. Includes itself.
-   ( : Exclusive. Excludes itself.

<!--listend-->

```text
(0, 5) = 1, 2, 3, 4
(0, 5] = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
[0, 5) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
[0, 5] = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```


## Napkin numbers {#napkin-numbers}


### CPU {#cpu}

-   13.2ns is a couple hundred cycles


### Locks {#locks}

-   Laptop can Lock &amp; unlock 61570760 times a second.
-   Laptop can count to 2 billion in 1 second.
-   So locks are expensive. This is second order reason why [parallel]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}}) is able to do shit faster.
-   When we hit Amdahl's law, need to check how split up the problem into spaces that don't require synchronization/serialisation.
