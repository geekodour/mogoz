## Physical Medium {#physical-medium}

-   HDD
-   SSD
-   Those devices have a connector that speaks a certain transfer protocol, which is usually a SCSI or ATA cable.

## Storage layers {#storage-layers}

See [Exta FS Info](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall19/cos316/lectures/06-file-systems-1-extra.pdf)


### Block layer {#block-layer}

See [Memory Hierarchy]({{< relref "20221101213401-memory_hierarchy.md" >}})
Block layer divides the storage device into fixed-sized "blocks" of contiguous memory

-   HDD: Spinning platters &amp; moving arms
-   Tape: Single contiguous magnetic stripe.
-   SSDs: Arrays of NAND flash

#### Superblock {#superblock}

-   Superblock is file system metadata (Eg. FS type, size, status, free and allocated blocks etc. and metadata of metadata). Critical to the FS, so redundant copies are stored.
-   `Superblock` is defined by the `FS` but actually present in the `partition`.
    -   If the superblock of a partition `/var` becomes corrupt
    -   The FS in question (`/var`) cannot be `mounted` by the OS.
    -   In this case you may need to run `fsck` to pick a backup copy of the superblock and attempt to recover the FS.
        -   [The many faces of fsck [LWN.net]​](https://lwn.net/Articles/248180/)

```shell
λ sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda3 | rg superblock

```


#### Layout {#layout}

Layout is specific to FS. Let's take [EXT4 Layout](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ext4/overview.html#layout) for example. It has one inode table per block group which tracks only inodes in that group

### File/inode layer {#file-inode-layer}

Files often contain data that spans multiple blocks. It uses `inode` to specify a file.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101164723-storage-689533999.png" >}}


#### Max file size (for `ext4`) {#max-file-size--for-ext4}

-   See `cat  /etc/mke2fs.conf`
-   Max file size depends on the block address mapping for `inodes`. Direct, Indirect Block Offset, Double Indirect Block Offset, Triple Indirect Block Offset etc. See [4. Dynamic Structures — The Linux Kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ext4/dynamic.html#direct-indirect-block-addressing)

<!--listend-->

```shell
λ sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda3 | rg -i "Block|inodes" # trimmed results, in bytes
Inode count:              28966912
Block count:              115838208
Block size:               4096
Inode size:               256

# (115838208 * 4096)/(10^9) = 474GB (my SSD size)
```

-   Max file size and Max file system/volume size are different. See [What are the file and file system size limitations](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1532)
-   ext4 max block count : 2^32 =&gt; (2^32 \* 4096)/(10^9) = 16TiB (Max file size)
-   The `64bit` flag allows blocks greater than 2^32
-   Smallest possible blocksize for ext4 is 1024 bytes.


#### inode table size {#inode-table-size}

-   `bytes-per-inode`  is the same as `inode_ratio` . This is a config option, not a property of the partition.

<!--listend-->

```shell
# inode_count = (blocks_count * blocksize) / inode_ratio
# inode_count = (partition_size_in_bytes) / inode_ratio
# inode_table_size = inode_count * inode_size
```

-   As a general rule of thumb the `inode_ratio` should not be smaller than the `blocksize` because you cannot (easily) store more than one file in one block.


### Directory layer {#directory-layer}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101164723-storage-44238633.png" >}}

-   Unix directories are lists of association structures, each of which contains one filename and one inode number.
-   `dentry`


## LVM (Logical Volume Manager) {#lvm--logical-volume-manager}

![](/ox-hugo/20221101164723-storage-431061910.png)
See [LVM - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LVM)

-   A layer above physical partitions that allows multiple partitions to appear as one.
-   Grow a filesystem by adding physical space
-   Physical disk like as disk or partition to be used with lvm
-   LVM is useful if you want to use LUKS to encrypt your root, swap and other partitions in one encrypted volume.
-   It sort of is an alternative(less featured) to [ZFS]({{< relref "20230623091743-zfs.md" >}}) and btrfs. In was it's just a volume manager.


### What's the usual blueprint like? {#what-s-the-usual-blueprint-like}

-   `esp(/boot/efi)` and `boot(/boot)` are separate `physical partitions`, not placed within LVM, because Grub has to access them at boot time.

### Random notes {#random-notes}

-   Install linux distro on LVM partition
-   Allows you to continue expanding the partition by adding disk on the fly
-   It's similar to RAID in a way that it gives an unified view of the underlying disks but doesn't give redudancy and other fancy things that RAID gives you

#### Practices of using LVM in the Cloud {#practices-of-using-lvm-in-the-cloud}

-   My verdict: Don't do LVM in the cloud unless you absolutely have a certain usecase
    -   We can have multiple EBS disk mounted at diff mountpoints and our applications can make use of it. So not always the case that if multiple disks you need LVM etc.
-   People have different needs and people do run ZFS/btrfs/LVM on top of Cloud volumes like AWS EBS. See [AWS]({{< relref "20231228230358-aws.md" >}}) for more info around EBS. But usually if you just have one disk, or even multiple disk and you're fine they being [multiple disks you don't need LVM.](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-lv-on-ebs-partition)
-   LVM also has snapshotting feature, but we already have snapshotting at cloud vendor volume level so this becomes redundant
-   When you're running VMs in the cloud, we can attach volumes. These volume allow themselves to be modified. Then you need to resize the partition and filesystem. From what I see, if it's only one volume disk that you're using, the steps needed are more or less the same with and without LVM.
-   If you'er using multiple disks in the cloud however for some reason, LVM can help. But Volumes can grow pretty big so its unlikely you'd need to add another disk, unless there's specific io requirements etc.
-   There are other clever uses of LVM on the cloud

## Disk usage patterns {#disk-usage-patterns}


### Disk usage patterns in cloud vm v/s Bare metal {#disk-usage-patterns-in-cloud-vm-v-s-bare-metal}

-   See [LVM (Logical Volume Manager)](#lvm--logical-volume-manager)
-   See [LVM for the OS Disks in cloud environments](https://serverfault.com/questions/1158359/questioning-why-lvm-for-the-os-disks-in-cloud-environments-is-not-recommended)


#### How LVM becomes redundant in cloud VMs {#how-lvm-becomes-redundant-in-cloud-vms}

-   Instead of adding one or a few big disks and partitioning them in the VM(as we do in bare metal), we add each potential volume as an individual disk containing at most one partition.
-   When you need to extend space, you increase the virtual disk in the virtualization environment, and then grow a partition and FS in a VM. This is now your LVM(the idea of it is being executed by the vendor/platform so we don't really need to do it inside our vm).


#### What disks do we need in cloud VMs {#what-disks-do-we-need-in-cloud-vms}

-   In most cases you will need a root FS and data FS, e.g. two virtual disks, and chances are the root FS disk of ~30 GB will never need to be resized.
-   Databases often suggest using separate storage for write ahead logs; that will require addition of a dedicated virtual disk anyway, so to place it onto separate storage in the virtualization environment.


## RAID {#raid}


### What {#what}

-   with raid you store in a way that if a drive fails, you lose no data. (in particular types of raids)
-   raid no substiutes for data.
