## Planning is important {#planning-is-important}

-   Abby began researching and found plenty of resources to help people plan for the birth of a child, buy a home, send kids to school, and plan their finances and retirement. But after retirement planning, that was it. There was a big hole—death—not addressed. It didn’t seem right that the only unavoidable life stage, and the most scary and overwhelming one, didn’t have any helpful, down-to-earth resources or tools to guide people.
-   In order to really make a difference for people at their time of greatest need, we had to help people get a plan in place ahead of time. That way, if a tragedy or emergency struck, their families would have easy access to everything they needed.
-   Over time, as more and more people started using Everplans, we realized the site wasn’t about death—it was about life. Because getting everything organized lets you live to the fullest, knowing you’re prepared for anything, having done your very best for those you love.


## Planning is not hard {#planning-is-not-hard}

-   One of the greatest frustrations of life is not knowing what you’re going to need or when you’re going to need it. The idea is for the crucial aspects of yours or a loved one’s life to be in complete and clear order, so no one is left with a stressful mess to untangle.
-   Even people who think they’ve covered all the bases still often leave inadvertent complications behind for their family.


## Planning is liberating {#planning-is-liberating}

-   Defaults are the excruciating ordeals they’ll be forced to face if you choose to do nothing.
-   We know organizing every aspect of your life isn’t like a five-day juice cleanse, getting a new hairdo, or going full Marie Kondo on your closet and dresser. The results aren’t immediate, and you might not be around to enjoy many of the benefits.
-   Since everyone’s life is filled with different priorities, it’s obvious that everyone’s plan is different.
-   Money is often the cause of most issues, and perhaps you don’t want your family going to war over what you leave behind.


## Access Granted {#access-granted}

-   The reason these numbers hit so close to home for us is that we are maniacally obsessive about security protocols. (Password Managers)
-   The phone PIN is still required if phone is restarted even if you're using finger printing
-   don't forget to keep 2FA backup codes in password managers
-   The point of these extra security measures is to keep bad people out and allow good people to get in when needed.
-   ATM pins etc.


## Money {#money}

-   For years people have told us they’ve avoided planning because they don’t want all their sensitive information in one place where others can easily find it. What they don’t realize is that the amount of money they have doesn’t matter. What matters is letting someone know the name of their bank, or the place where they keep investments, and that’s not sensitive information.


## Legal {#legal}

-   Estate planning: will(dead), POA(alive), Trusts(works dead or alive)
-   Creating a will is essentially free, many online sites let you create one
