Everything in unix are files, hard drives, pipes, network devices, `stdin/stdout` etc. Let's separate it into regular and special files.


## Regular files {#regular-files}

These are disk files. See [Filesystems]({{< relref "20221101145053-filesystems.md" >}})


## Directory files {#directory-files}

-   See [Directory layer]({{< relref "20221101164723-storage.md#directory-layer" >}})
-   File that contains mapping of file names with inode numbers
-   We call the process of removing a `dentry` “unlinking”. If no names point to the inode, the last link is removed, then the file is considered removed and the data freed.


## Symbolic link files {#symbolic-link-files}

-   Returns only a single string of text representing the location of its target, the other file it points to. Like an alias.
-   An improvement is fast symlink which is basically storing the filepath in the inode structure if the structure can take that in.


## Hard link files {#hard-link-files}

-   Hard links are simply directory entries.
-   All files have at least one directory entry and thus **all files must at least have one hard link**.
-   They are that association between a `name` and an `inode`.
-   Multiple hard links = Multiple names to the same file
-   Creating hard links to directories is forbidden (infinite loop)
-   Max no. of hard links to a single file is limited by the size of the ref counter inside the inode


## Named pipe files {#named-pipe-files}

-   Also called `FIFO`, File used for IPC.
-   Traditional pipe is "unnamed" and disappear as soon as the process finishes, the named pipe is a file that can be reused. Allows for transfer of info in a pipeline manner through processes that don’t share the same parent.
-   Created via `mkfifo`, can be deleted using `rm`
-   Not so popular nowadays, use sockets instead.


## Socket files {#socket-files}

-   Unix domain sockets `AF_UNIX`
-   Similar to named pipe
-   While named pipe are unidirectional, sockets are full duplex.
-   What can we send
    -   Data
    -   File Descriptors: Allows a process to manipulate a file it may not already have access to.


## Device files {#device-files}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230314123832-unix_files-918593538.png" >}}

-   All devices, pseudo or not are implemented as device drivers in the kernel. _(This statement is not verified)_
-   Device files have `major` and `minor` number stored as `inode` attributes. The meaning of a device file determined by these 2 numbers.
    -   `major` number: The driver to use
    -   `minor` number: The device that the driver controls
-   **Use:** Communication w a piece of hardware, Accessing system resources(`/dev/null`, `/dev/random` )


### Device Driver {#device-driver}

-   **Not all** device files are handled by a file system driver.
-   Device files are handled by specific drivers for every one of them. It's the **Device Driver**, a program that controls some type of device attached to the computer, sw interface to hw devices.
-   Device Driver Functions: HW device discovery, detecting state changes, sending events to udevd etc.


### Character device {#character-device}

-   Unbuffered / Stream. Usually read/written sequentially.
-   Also called `raw devices` sometimes.


### Block device {#block-device}

-   Buffered. May be accessed randomly.
-   Usually for things like disks, which behave like large, fixed-size files.
-   **Linux specific:** To represent disk devices, Linux only uses block devices, it does give option to simulate character file opens at all.
-   See [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Device_file#Block_devices) for naming conventions of different physical block devices.


### Pseudo device {#pseudo-device}

-   These are device nodes that do not have a backing physical device. They are either character or block devices.
-   These are sometimes also called virtual devices. `major` number(device driver) is usually `1`. (eg. Try `stat /dev/null`)
-   These devices are mapped to certain paths in the file system. Mostly that's `/dev`
-   Can be created using `mknod`


#### /dev {#dev}

-   Naming convention used by files in `/dev` is a complete mess.
-   There will be entries in `/dev` for devices you do not have. (i.e They don't always correspond to physical devices)
-   `/dev` in modern system will have a `devtmpfs` fs mounted.
    -   `devtmpfs` is a device manager in the form of a filesystem that displays each device as files.
    -   It allows devices to be dynamically shown without storing on disk (it's stored in memory).
-   Some examples: `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/full`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/stdin`
