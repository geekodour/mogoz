-   Tweet from Geoffrey Litt
    -   Software environments that mold to user needs, not the other way around
    -   Ingredients may include: enriching documents w/ behavior [a la Potluck](https://www.inkandswitch.com/potluck/), LLMs for code editing, local-first as an enabling foundation...

-  Thoughts from from [azlenelza](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1269696508804268032)

    -   Enable people to collectively learn and build knowledge as a group?
    -   System that goes beyond forums and linear discussion threads, with highlights and summarization to distill key ideas

    -   Think about
        -   Teaching peers as an individual helps to identify gaps and deepen your own knowledge of a topic
        -   Teaching future learners as a group perhaps helps identify gaps and deepen collective knowledge
