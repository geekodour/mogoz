    -   Playful software != video games. I mean tinkerable, whimsical, playful consumer software: creative software, social networks, dating apps, messengers
    -   Play that's not segregated from ordinary life
    -   Tinkerability, accessibility, low cost, easy to make mistakes — fun

-  Thoughts from from [azlenelza](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1269696508804268032)

    -   Enable people to collectively learn and build knowledge as a group?
    -   System that goes beyond forums and linear discussion threads, with highlights and summarization to distill key ideas

        ![](/ox-hugo/20230806231355-human_computer_interaction_hci-516320407.png)
    -   Think about
        -   Teaching peers as an individual helps to identify gaps and deepen your own knowledge of a topic
        -   Teaching future learners as a group perhaps helps identify gaps and deepen collective knowledge
