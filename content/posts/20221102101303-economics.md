## FAQ {#faq}


### How it works (VC Funding) {#how-it-works--vc-funding}

-   `<some fund>` --&gt; `LP` --&gt; `VC` --&gt; `PVT LTD.`
-   `LP` : Only job of an `LP` is to manage money. `LLP` is limited in that they don't manage money.
    -   One would open an `LP` in an intention to borrow money from a source and return that back to the source while making some profit.
-   `<some fund>` can be bank, some reach family, pvt ltd. So why would any rich org become a source of fund?
    -   Because it wants to make a "societal" change and it possibly can't do it on its own
    -   So it'll outsource the money to an `LP` who promises to fund `VC` working with `startups/pvt ltd.` working in those areas.
