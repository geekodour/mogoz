It is the way a given instruction set architecture (ISA) is implemented in a particular processor. Processors with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set.

> For example, the Intel Pentium and the AMD Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set, but have radically different internal designs.
