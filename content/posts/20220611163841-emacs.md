## TIL {#til}

-   some variables only appear when they are in certain modes. eg. org-download variables only show up when you're in a org buffer
-   when using org-download, even if it supports directory traversal better not
    use it because its not intended to be used that way. eg. the renaming
    breaks. so if you really want to put things inside some other directory for
    the pictures better just set the file level org-download-image-dir as its a
    buffer local variable.
