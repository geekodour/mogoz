Each thread executes a thread function


## pthreads (posix threads) {#pthreads--posix-threads}

-   A `pthread` can be either be created as
    -   A **joinable thread** (the default)
    -   A **detached thread** (cleaned up automatically when it terminates)
-   Thread cancellation are of three types(`pthread_setcanceltype`)
    -   sync
    -   async
    -   uncancellable (critical section)


## Thread Safety {#thread-safety}

Libraries can be: Thread safe, Conditionally safe, Not thread safe


### Implementations {#implementations}


#### Avoid Shared State {#avoid-shared-state}

-   Re-entrancy
    -   Subroutine is called reentrant if multiple invocations can safely run concurrently, i.e execution and then safely be called again/re-enter before its previous invocations complete execution.
    -   See [Interrupts]({{< relref "20221101173720-interrupts.md" >}}), Soft IRQs are re-enterant functions.
-   Tread local storage
    -   It's just storage specific to the running thread
    -   Many threads can have a variable called `a`; `a` is local to each thread. One usage can be multiple threads accumulating information into a global variable with some kind of sync ofc.
-   Immutable objects
    -   What functional languages do


#### Cannot avoid shared state {#cannot-avoid-shared-state}

-   Mutual Exclusion
    -   Locks and stuff. See [Concurrency]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}})
-   Atomic Operations
