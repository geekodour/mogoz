### Preemptive/Non Preemptive {#preemptive-non-preemptive}

-   Having the ability the preempt means less chances of starvation.


### Native Threads {#native-threads}

OS threads basically


#### pthreads (posix threads) {#pthreads--posix-threads}

-   A `pthread` can be either be created as
    -   A **joinable thread** (the default)
    -   A **detached thread** (cleaned up automatically when it terminates)
-   Thread cancellation are of three types(`pthread_setcanceltype`)
    -   sync
    -   async
    -   uncancellable (critical section)


### Green Threads {#green-threads}

-   Language agnostic idea, implementations differ.
-   User-level threads that are scheduled by a runtime/scheduler/library instead of the OS. They usually sit on top of OS threads.
-   Green threads have threading semantics, that means that you need to deal with mutexes, atomics, etc.
-   You should code as though the context can switch at any time
-   Python's greenlets. Golang has mix of greenthreads and os threads w goroutines etc. Ruby's fibers are green threads. (See [Python Concurrency]({{< relref "20230824010507-python_concurrency.md" >}}))


### Coroutines {#coroutines}

-   It can be used for concurrency, it's [cooperative multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29#Scheduling) when that happens.
-   See [Coroutines]({{< relref "20230516192836-coroutines.md" >}})


## Thread Safety {#thread-safety}

-   Thread-Safety is just the ability to maintain an objectâ€™s [invariants]({{< relref "20230122140847-general_programming.md#invariants" >}}) in a multi-threaded environment.
-   Libraries/Methods can be: Thread safe, Conditionally safe, Not thread safe


## When to use synchronization? {#when-to-use-synchronization}

-   Always avoid synchronization/shared-state if possible.
-   If possible to keep things thread-local, do it, even if it costs some memory.


### No Shared State {#no-shared-state}

-   Re-entrancy
    -   Subroutine is called reentrant if multiple invocations can safely run concurrently, i.e execution and then safely be called again/re-enter before its previous invocations complete execution.
    -   See [Interrupts]({{< relref "20221101173720-interrupts.md" >}}), Soft IRQs are re-enterant functions.
-   Tread local storage
    -   It's just storage specific to the running thread
    -   Many threads can have a variable called `a`; `a` is local to each thread. One usage can be multiple threads accumulating information into a global variable with some kind of sync ofc.
-   Immutable objects: What functional languages do
-   [Concurrency in Golang]({{< relref "20230412015037-concurrency_in_golang.md" >}}) provides us with channels which allow goroutines to communicate w each other via message passing rather than shared state.


### There is shared state {#there-is-shared-state}

-   Mutual Exclusion (Blocking)
    -   Locks and stuff. See [Concurrency]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}})
-   Atomic Operations (Non blocking)
    -   See [Lockfree]({{< relref "20230522154454-lockfree.md" >}})
