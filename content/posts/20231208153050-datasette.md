## FAQ {#faq}


### SQL injection? {#sql-injection}

-   Picked from [Arc Note: Datasette - Simon Willison](https://architecturenotes.co/datasette-simon-willison/)
-   DB opened with readonly
-   Has filter on query for safe [statements](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/280ff372ab30df244f6c54f6f3002da57334b3d7/datasette/utils/__init__.py?ref=architecturenotes.co#L208-L215)


## The ecosystem {#the-ecosystem}

[Datasette](https://datasette.io/) is built on top of [sqlite]({{< relref "20230702184501-sqlite.md" >}}), a tool for exploring and publishing data. Eg. You can create a website/API out of your data. It can be combined with other tools and extended with plugins.


### Distributions {#distributions}

These are different ways datasette is distributed, in a way these also fall under what we consider "tools" under datasette ecosystem.

-   Datasette: Python web application, CLI, Server, (can be deployed)
-   Datasette Lite : In the browser (Runs datasette in pyodide in a [web worker]({{< relref "20230503160302-web_performance.md#web-workers" >}}), see [WebAssembly]({{< relref "20230510200213-webassembly.md" >}})). Uses [datasette-client](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-client).
    -   "So each time the user clicks a link in the parent window, that URL is sent to the web worker where Datasette generates the full HTML of the page just as if it was running as a regular server-side application."
    -   "The web worker sends that HTML (and the status code and content-type) back to the parent window, which injects it into the page using innerHTML."
-   Datasette Desktop: macOS desktop application (Electron), uses  [datasette-app-support](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support) and [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone)


### Official Tools(46) {#official-tools--46}

These can be run independently but also has useful usecases when used with datasette. See [Datasette Tools](https://datasette.io/tools).

-   `<source>-to-sqlite` : The primary idea is that, we somehow dump the data into sqlite and then we can easily explore the data using datasette. Source can be anything. There are ~20 such official tools. You can ofcourse build your own.
-   `other tools`: These are tools that usually can be considered utilities, some of these are related to datasette, some are related to [sqlite]({{< relref "20230702184501-sqlite.md" >}}), some may not be related to any but indirectly can be useful etc. Following are some picked tools that I think are useful to me currently.
    -   [sqlite-utils](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils)
    -   [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper) (mentioned in [Archival]({{< relref "20230115032923-archival.md" >}}))
    -   strip-tags
    -   db-to-sqlite
    -   git-history
    -   airtable-export
    -   markdown-to-sqlite
    -   geo (See [Geography]({{< relref "20221109130937-geography.md" >}}))
        -   shapefile-to-sqlite
        -   geocode-sqlite
        -   geojson-to-sqlite
        -   download-tiles


### Official Plugins(136) {#official-plugins--136}

Plugins extend Datasette with new functionality, [Data Visualization]({{< relref "20230504114958-data_visualization.md" >}}), [Authentication]({{< relref "20230301191046-authentication.md" >}}), more [data processing]({{< relref "20230405003455-data_engineering.md" >}}), other post/pre processing/debugging stuff. You can build [your own](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html). Following are some picked plugins that I think are useful to me currently. Some(`sqlite-X`) of these plugins directly work as [sqlite]({{< relref "20230702184501-sqlite.md" >}}) extensions aswell, asg017 [maintains a log](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-ecosystem) of these. Datasette uses [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for this.

-   [datasette-parquet](https://github.com/cldellow/datasette-parquet): Even though datasette does not directly work with [DuckDB]({{< relref "20231123234702-duckdb.md" >}}), this allows you to do so.
