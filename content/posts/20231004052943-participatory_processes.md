## Some processes {#some-processes}

-   Jurocracy: rule of law. People submit requests to a central committee, who then decide what to accept and produce new versions of the language.
-   Tyrrany: rule of the one or the few. Whatever happens within the community, an individual or controlling group direct the language the way they want.
-   Megalofonocracy: rule of the loud voices. People submit requests to a notice board, and whichever ones get noticed, get implemented.
