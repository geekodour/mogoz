## Sever and Network side {#sever-and-network-side}

-   Congestion control (to protect the network)
-   Flow control (to protect the server)


## CSS {#css}

-   lol
-   `rem`:
    -   1rem is 1 times your base unit in your HTML root (hence root em), it can be anything.
    -   Most use (tailwind included) 16px
    -   Eg. For `font-size`, if you set `html { font-size: 10px; }`, 1rem would be 10px;


## Fonts and Icons {#fonts-and-icons}

I use svelte, so this is specific to svelte but should work for others aswell


### Icons {#icons}

-   Icons: `pnpm i -D unplugin-icons`
    -   Update Sveltekit vite config(as a vite plugin) as in the unplugin docs
-   then `pnpm i -D @iconify/json` (Search icons across all icon sets [here](https://icones.js.org/collection/uil?s=anal&icon=uil%3Aalign-alt))
-   After this, we should be able to do:
    -   `import WhateverWeWantToNameIcon from '~~icons/<PATH_HERE>;`
    -   Path can be picked from the URL: <https://icon-sets.iconify.design> when we pick a icon (the premade template things not super useful for us)


### Fonts {#fonts}


## Development Frameworks {#development-frameworks}


### Web Components {#web-components}

-   My current conclusion is that, i'll not go near web components.

### Frameworks {#frameworks}


#### HTMX {#htmx}

-   "All HTMX does, is make the browser better at hypermedia by giving us more options regarding what can trigger an HTTP request and allowing us to update a part of the page rather than a full page reload."
-   [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/book/contents/) (Book)
-   Hotwire is a library with similar goals to HTMX, driven by the Ruby on Rails world.

-  Routing in Svelte

    -   We could use conditional components but using SvelteKit with `@sveltejs/adapter-static` along with disabling SSR is much more straightforward

-  State Management in Svelte

    -   See [State Management Libraries]({{< relref "20221108105322-state_management_libraries.md" >}})
    -   See [Svelte State Management Guide](https://joyofcode.xyz/svelte-state-management) (Flowchart in button)
    -   state in svelte inherently is not global, but we can create a global state in a dedicated file such as `store.ts` but there is no such requirement.
    -   Since we're using connect for [Protocol Buffers]({{< relref "20230522131118-protocol_buffers.md" >}}), it has something called [connectrpc/connect-query-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-query-es) which branches of TanStackQuery
        -   Issue is the svelte variant [is not very well supported yet](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-query-es/issues/324)

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Pre-render

        -   We want a SPA which talks to our own backend not the sveltekit backend, we don't need sveltekit backend

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  What's the combo of transtackQuery, svelteStore and PageLoad?

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Other notes

        -   `+page.js` can't use the `$` (autosubscribe) shortcut to access the value from a writable store.
            -   You'll need to explicitly subscribe
            -   Make sure to unsubscribe if not using `$`
