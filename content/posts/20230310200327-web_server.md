## The case of 0.0.0.0 &amp; Localhost {#the-case-of-0-dot-0-dot-0-dot-0-and-localhost}


### What about 127.0.0.1 {#what-about-127-dot-0-dot-0-dot-1}

127.0.0.1 is normally the IP address assigned to the "loopback" or local-only interface.


### Multiple meanings of 0.0.0.0 {#multiple-meanings-of-0-dot-0-dot-0-dot-0}

Meaning of `0.0.0.0` is contextual.

> non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target

-   Route entry
    -   Usually means the default route.
-   Webserver
    -   0.0.0.0 means all **IPv4 addresses** on the local machine.
    -   Listen on every available network interface
    -   This explicitly limits the listening daemon to IPv4 for no good reason.
-   DHCP
    Used as source IP by clients during DHCP.

## FAQ {#faq}


### Sockets and Connections {#sockets-and-connections}

-   A connection (See [HTTP]({{< relref "20230222161545-http.md" >}})) does not occupy a `port`.
-   The only hard limit for connections the number of open file descriptors on the server.  But performance can degrade by CPU bound/ io bound operations.
-   Every connection creates a new `socket`. Some operating systems let you load balance incoming connections between multiple sockets.


### How does a web sever handle incoming requests? {#how-does-a-web-sever-handle-incoming-requests}

-   A webserver usually has 1 listening socket.
-   But "accepting" the connection duplicates that socket and sets the remote IP and port on the copy.
-   So in most cases, no. of connections = no. of active sockets
-   I am not sure how it works in the case of UDP.

## Notes on Caddy {#notes-on-caddy}


### Local development {#local-development}


#### What domain to use? `.local`, `.internal`, `.custom`? {#what-domain-to-use-dot-local-dot-internal-dot-custom}

-   Most systems don’t resolve `*.local` to your localhost. But `*.localhost` does usually work in browsers (they directly map those `*.localhost` domains to `localhost`, and don’t try to use DNS to resolve them).
-   So in summary, go with `x.localhost`, this means we avoid having to do any `/etc/hosts` or DNS resolution stuff.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Using custom domain for local dev

    ALTERNATIVELY, you could use your actual domain for local development

    -   this is useful if you want to same-site cookies etc, where your other 3rd party service is hosted in an actual subdomain(eg. r2 bucket etc)
    -   Eg.
        -   set an `A` record for `app.mylocal.foo.org` to 127.0.0.1
        -   set an `A` record for `api.mylocal.foo.org` to 127.0.0.1
    -   In your local machine have caddy be running on `port:80` and add that `app.mylocal.foo.org` to handle the reverse proxy.
    -   You'll generate the [TLS]({{< relref "20230210181907-tls.md" >}}) certs like:
        ```nil
          mkcert "foo.org" "*.foo.org" "*.local.foo.org"
        ```

        -   NOTE: Second level wildcards are NOT supported by browsers
            -   [Wildcard SSL certificate for second-level subdomain - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/104160/wildcard-ssl-certificate-for-second-level-subdomain)
            -   <https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/30>
    -   You should be done


#### How will that domain get mapped, manually edit /etc/hosts? {#how-will-that-domain-get-mapped-manually-edit-etc-hosts}


#### How will the tls certs get provisioned for those? {#how-will-the-tls-certs-get-provisioned-for-those}

-   You can use the `tls internal`


### Internal services {#internal-services}

You can use the denied directive

```hcl
# I use some services (like Vaultwarden) only on my LAN-Net, or if I'm "on the way" using VPN. So I configured my Caddy-Instance like this:
# That ensures that it is simply not possible to connect my Server through WAN, even if I expose my Caddy-Server to the Internet.

myvaultwarden.mydomain.com {
        @denied not remote_ip private_ranges
        abort @denied
        reverse_proxy 192.168.1.100:80
}
```

But you could also simply run another instance of caddy in an internal interface(the way i do it, in the tailscale interface)
