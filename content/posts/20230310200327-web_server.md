## The case of 0.0.0.0 &amp; Localhost {#the-case-of-0-dot-0-dot-0-dot-0-and-localhost}


### What about 127.0.0.1 {#what-about-127-dot-0-dot-0-dot-1}

127.0.0.1 is normally the IP address assigned to the "loopback" or local-only interface.


### Multiple meanings of 0.0.0.0 {#multiple-meanings-of-0-dot-0-dot-0-dot-0}

Meaning of `0.0.0.0` is contextual.

> non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target

-   Route entry
    -   Usually means the default route.
-   Webserver
    -   0.0.0.0 means all **IPv4 addresses** on the local machine.
    -   Listen on every available network interface
    -   This explicitly limits the listening daemon to IPv4 for no good reason.
-   DHCP
    Used as source IP by clients during DHCP.

## FAQ {#faq}


### Sockets and Connections {#sockets-and-connections}

-   A connection (See [HTTP]({{< relref "20230222161545-http.md" >}})) does not occupy a port.
-   The only hard limit for connections the number of open file descriptors on the server.  But performance can degrade by CPU bound/ io bound operations.
-   Every connection creates a new socket. Some operating systems let you load balance incoming connections between multiple sockets.


### How does a web sever handle incoming requests? {#how-does-a-web-sever-handle-incoming-requests}

-   A webserver usually has 1 listening socket.
-   But "accepting" the connection duplicates that socket and sets the remote IP and port on the copy.
-   So in most cases, no. of connections = no. of active sockets
-   I am not sure how it works in the case of UDP.
