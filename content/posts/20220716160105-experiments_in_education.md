## General Experiments {#general-experiments}


### Stupid regulations {#stupid-regulations}

-   Remove obsolete regulations in education, Eg. Studying all subjects in the first year


### Make tactical knowledge more accessible {#make-tactical-knowledge-more-accessible}

-   Internet connects us all but people choose to not participate this is loss of knowledge when there is availability but is inaccessible due to ignorance.
-   Processionals should be available to answer random questions from people from outside the industry.
-   Eg. Not a lot of Indian electricians are on reddit , not a lot of farmers from nalbari are on reddit etc.


## Personal Experiments {#personal-experiments}


### Analysis/Research {#analysis-research}

-   Proper analysis of how the education system of India came to be.
-   Comparison of education system in different countries.
-   What happened in history that education in the northeast is still so bad.
-   Proper analysis of how and why some courses are not worth it
-   Strict Asian parents equals better education, is that true?
-   How much impact on education are NGOs having? Does more number of NGOs mean better education for the region? Why the actual regulatory body not enough to maintain the quality of education.
-   It's easy to get misled while searching for things to learn on the internet especially if you're a 8th grader. Study on browsing habits for kids.
-   Khan academy showed that short videos 10 minutes long work better than longer ones with pause quizzes. Basically makes the student feel like she is in a one-on-one session. Study different organizations and their ideas and make proper technical reports on them. Basically, study what others have done, what we could copy and what we could change.
-   According to data, a large budget for education does not mean better results. How and where do we invest the money matters a lot more than how much is invested in education. Verify for yourself.


### Libraries {#libraries}

-   mesh tech+local libraries
-   _"Ask for the librarian or business center's support in helping you conduct specific research. They are trained in this and they are there to help you learn how to do this."_ - saw this as a reddit comment. Is this what librarians here in India do? I had no idea. It's so awesome.
-   Unavailability of good books in India


### Organization {#organization}

-   A timeline/landscape map of the prominent NGOs and organizations working in education, also govt organizations. See the [database map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXOMBpMY6oNPqcHxDoi0jIeu3P1hwnfz/view?usp=sharing)


### Student experiments {#student-experiments}

-   1 week mentorship program


### Testgrid {#testgrid}

-   Build a [testgrid](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/testgrid) for the education system
-   we've to design tests for the system in the first place
-   on top of fixing bugs in the system; people can start building products to resolve the inefficiencies of the system.
