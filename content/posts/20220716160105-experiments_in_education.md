## General Experiments {#general-experiments}

-   Remove obsolete regulations in education, Eg. Studying all subjects in the first year
-   Phycology tests eg. Internet usage should be done in every educational institutions time to time to see if students are doing all good. If not it's time to have a seminar on it!
-   There is always an existing curriculum that is followed by any educational institution. We can experiment with adding a layer of abstraction, say a wrapper to the base layer of the curriculum which will make it easier for the students to understand and allow for quick higher-order modifications. Modeling this as a ladder of abstraction will also allow us to do the opposite and apply something similar to the ideas of historicism. This will also make the authorities accountable.
-   So many kids make art, some kids in villages make awesome art. They can really income money using their skills. Make digital art more accessible. The broader idea to this is to enable kids to make money which is considered an taboo in India.
-   Processionals should be available to answer random questions from people from outside the industry. Eg. Not a lot of Indian electricians are on reddit , not a lot of farmers from nalbari are on reddit etc. Internet connects us all but some people choose to not participate this is loss of knowledge when there is availability but is inaccessible due to ignorance.
-   A new kind of license for books, that allows a book that's extremely helpful and accepted as will help humanity to be sold at cheaper price. Build a cult around it like opensource so that people automatically by default do it.


## Personal Experiments {#personal-experiments}

-   Proper analysis of how the education system of India came to be.
-   Comparison of education system in different countries.
-   mesh tech+local libraries
    -   Unavailability of good books in India
-   A timeline/landscape map of the prominent NGOs and organizations working in education, also govt organizations. [Example](<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXOMBpMY6oNPqcHxDoi0jIeu3P1hwnfz/view?usp=sharing>) of the Database map.
-   Strict Asian parents equals better education, is that true? ****Research****!
-   How much impact on education are NGOs having? Does more number of NGOs mean better education for the region? Why the actual regulatory body not enough to maintain the quality of education.
-   How to open an educational NGO, guide. take help from the ycombinator blog and other books when writing this. Eg. Have a Wikipedia page for sure. your description should not be too abstract, etc.
-   Need to start and end an ngo with return code of 0 before i die.
-   1 week mentorship program
-   Marc Anderson said every failed idea of the dot-com bubble will work now because of the current situation of the internet. You've to think about what is the future of education, you've to live in the future to have that advantage and apply it in education.
-   Students get to simulate their life and careers in a game kind of way. Bad decisions will have them doomed. They can live different lives before they try it for real.
-   Whatever i create should be [<https://indieweb.org/PESOS>](<https://indieweb.org/PESOS>) or whatever, rss and good api and open access to everything. [<https://consensualsoftware.com/>](<https://consensualsoftware.com/>)
-   Make some kind of bot to send static info about that org to their email, let them confirm if that info is up to date. rather than relying on the community to update. the bot can do that on yearly or every 6 months or so.
-   Build a [testgrid](<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/testgrid>) for the education system, for this we've to design tests for the system in the first place and following the analogy, rather than fixing bugs for the failed test; people can start building products to resolve the inefficiencies of the education system.
-   It's easy to get misled while searching for things to learn on the internet especially if you're a 8th grader. Study on browsing habits for kids.
-   Khan academy showed that short videos 10 minutes long work better than longer ones with pause quizzes. Basically makes the student feel like she is in a one-on-one session. Study different organizations and their ideas and make proper technical reports on them. Basically, study what others have done, what we could copy and what we could change.
-   According to data, a large budget for education does not mean better results. How and where do we invest the money matters a lot more than how much is invested in education.
-   Proper result analysis of how and why some courses are not worth it
-   What happened in history that education in the northeast is still so bad.
