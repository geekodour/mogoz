### Performance {#performance}

-   array of structs (AoS), rather than a struct of arrays (SoA). An SoA makes it so that the data is ordered contiguously, which is easy to read for the CPU, while an AoS structure interleaves different data (namely the x and y in this case), which is very annoying for the CPU. Apache Arrow built around this.


## Random dumps {#random-dumps}

-   SOLID
    -   These things are not strictly followed, eg. factory pattern breaks open/close of solid but we okay w it


## Glossary {#glossary}

-   [Loop Unrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling): Technique that attempts to optimize a program's execution speed at the expense of its binary size. It increase a program's speed by reducing or eliminating instructions that control the loop. [Duff's device](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/514118/how-does-duffs-device-work) is a way of manually implementing loop unrolling.
