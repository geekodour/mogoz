-   Source of data: Unlike OSM, it doesn't rely on a community of mappers who manually update maps. Instead, it aggregates data from a variety of sources such as: sensors, satellites, aerial images, government sources, as well as data provided from its members (e.g. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and TomTom).
-   USP: Focussing on enterprise customers
-   But it's cheaper than google maps as it's open
