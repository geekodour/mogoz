## FAQ {#faq}


### What is a construction? {#what-is-a-construction}

-   A way of combining basic building blocks, such as encryption algorithms, hash functions, and protocols, to create a higher-level cryptographic scheme or system.
-   Examples
    -   Block Ciphers : Modes of operations
    -   [Hashing]({{< relref "20231214201833-hashing.md" >}}): Eg. HMAC use a combination of a hash function and a secret key to provide integrity and authenticity.
    -   [PKI]({{< relref "20230417085602-pki.md" >}}): RSA, ECC(Elliptic Curve Cryptography) etc.
    -   Key Exchange: Diffie-Hellman key exchange etc.


### PRF? {#prf}

pseudorandom function


### AEAD? {#aead}

-   AEAD stands for "Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data."
-   [Why I have settled on XChaCha20+Blake3 as the AE suite of choice for my proje...](https://archive.is/20211201051906/https://mccarty.io/cryptography/2021/11/29/chacha20-blake3.html)


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Modes??? (ChatGPT generated) {#modes--chatgpt-generated}


#### block {#block}

1.  ****Electronic Codebook (ECB):****
    -   Each block of plaintext is independently encrypted with the same key.
    -   Identical plaintext blocks result in identical ciphertext blocks.

2.  ****Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):****
    -   Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
    -   Initialization Vector (IV) is used for the first block to break patterns.

3.  ****Cipher Feedback (CFB):****
    -   Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.
    -   Previous ciphertext block is fed back into the block cipher to generate a keystream.

4.  ****Output Feedback (OFB):****
    -   Similar to CFB but the block cipher encrypts a constant value (IV) to produce a keystream.
    -   The keystream is then XORed with the plaintext.

5.  ****Counter (CTR):****
    -   Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.
    -   Uses a counter as the input to the block cipher to generate a keystream.
    -   The counter is usually combined with a nonce.

6.  ****Galois/Counter Mode (GCM):****
    -   Combines the counter mode of operation with Galois field multiplication.
    -   Provides both confidentiality and authenticity.
    -   Widely used for authenticated encryption.


#### Stream Cipher Modes: {#stream-cipher-modes}

1.  **Synchronous Stream Ciphers:**
    -   Keyed bits are generated to form a pseudorandom keystream.
    -   The keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.
2.  ****Self-Synchronizing Stream Ciphers:****
    -   Previous ciphertext bits are used to generate the next key bits.
    -   Allows synchronization even if some ciphertext bits are lost or corrupted.
3.  ****Stream Cipher with Feedback (SCFB):****
    -   Similar to CFB mode for block ciphers.
    -   Uses the previous ciphertext bits to generate the next keystream.
4.  ****Combining Generators:****
    -   Multiple keystream generators are combined to improve security.
5.  ****Filter Generators:****
    -   Combines a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with a nonlinear filter.

### Encrypt passwords? {#encrypt-passwords}

-   Storing passwords HMAC encrypted is technique outdated by at least 10 years


### SCRAM {#scram}

> The beauty of SCRAM is that both authenticating parties (in this case, your client/application and PostgreSQL) can both verify that each party knows a secret without ever exchanging the secret. In this case, the secret is a PostgreSQL password!

-   [How to SCRAM in Postgres with pgBouncer | Crunchy Data Blog](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/pgbouncer-scram-authentication-postgresql)
-   [Get Your Insecure PostgreSQL Passwords to SCRAM | PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/jkatz05/get-your-insecure-postgresql-passwords-to-scram)
-   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5802>


#### Basics {#basics}

-   The basis of SCRAM is that both a client and a server
    -   will send each other a series of `cryptographic proofs` demonstrating that they know the secret (i.e. the password).
    -   Needed keys
        -   "Client Key"
        -   "Server Key" (Server needs to know)
        -   "Stored Key" (Server needs to know)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Client key

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230417101756-cryptography-1012986082.png" >}}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Stored key (Derived from Client key)

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230417101756-cryptography-874827191.png" >}}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Server key

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230417101756-cryptography-1847400133.png" >}}


#### Flow {#flow}

> You connect to you PG server using normal username and pass only, all this mumbo/jumbo is what your postgrest client library will handle. SCRAM is well supported.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Client

    > Sends the server a `"client proof"`

    -   `client proof = client key XOR client signature`
        -   `client signature = HMAC(one-time info of signing key) + stored key`
            -   `stored key = sha256(client key)`

<!--list-separator-->

-  Server

    > Derives the `client key` from `client proof` and verifies if it OK by taking a `SHA-256(client key)` and comparing it against `stored key`
    >
    > i.e Server uses the `stored key` for two different usecases

    -   Since server has `stored key`, and it only sends the one time info
        -   It can generate the `client signature`
    -   So once it gets the `client proof` from a client,
        -   `client key = client_signature XOR client_proof`

-  Flow when we're using PGBouncer

    -   [How to SCRAM in Postgres with pgBouncer | Crunchy Data Blog](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/pgbouncer-scram-authentication-postgresql)
    -   The above nicely describes how 2 parties are talking, when we have a 3rd party(pgbouncer) things get a little bit different
    -   `client key = salt(password)` , where `salt` is sent by the server at initial request
    -   `stored key = sha256(client key)`
    -   Flow
        -   In this flow, we're trusting the pgbouncer instance.
        -   client sends `client proof` to pgbouncer
        -   pgbouncer extracts the `client key` just liek pg would
        -   pgbouncer now generates a new `client proof` where pgbouncer is now the actual client and sends the new `client proof` to pg


#### Comparison with md5(See [Hashing]({{< relref "20231214201833-hashing.md" >}})) for [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) {#comparison-with-md5--see-hashing-20231214201833-hashing-dot-md---for-postgresql--20221102123302-postgresql-dot-md}

```nil
'md5' || md5(password + username)
```

-   If you have access to someone's
    -   username / password combination
    -   or their PostgreSQL MD5-styled hash
-   You could log into any PostgreSQL cluster where the user has the same username / password.
-   The md5 has a challenge/response thing but the password itself is not salted!

<!--list-separator-->

-  Attacks

    -   `Replay attacks`: These are prevented by md5 because there is a challenge/response component, so the md5 hash which is stored is not what is sent [across the wire.](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20160507155124.GP10850@tamriel.snowman.net)
        -   But someone with enough skills can still [try figuring things out.](https://launchbylunch.com/posts/2024/Jan/16/postgres-password-encryption/)
    -   `Gaining dump of the at-rest-hash`: If an attacker somehow gains access to the at-rest-hash, then they can figure out the actual password.
        -   Using something like SCRAM prevents this.

## Other topics {#other-topics}


### Forward secrecy {#forward-secrecy}

-   If you lose your key to an attacker today
    -   They still **can’t go** back and read yesterday’s messages
    -   They had to be there with the key yesterday to read them
-   Layman implementation
    -   2 secret keys: a short term session key and a longer-term trusted key.
    -   The session key is ephemeral (usually the product of a DH exchange)
    -   The trusted key signs the session key.
