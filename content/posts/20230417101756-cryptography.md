## FAQ {#faq}


### What is a construction? {#what-is-a-construction}

-   A way of combining basic building blocks, such as encryption algorithms, hash functions, and protocols, to create a higher-level cryptographic scheme or system.
-   Examples
    -   Block Ciphers : Modes of operations
    -   [Hashing]({{< relref "20231214201833-hashing.md" >}}): Eg. HMAC use a combination of a hash function and a secret key to provide integrity and authenticity.
    -   [PKI]({{< relref "20230417085602-pki.md" >}}): RSA, ECC(Elliptic Curve Cryptography) etc.
    -   Key Exchange: Diffie-Hellman key exchange etc.


### PRF? {#prf}

pseudorandom function


### AEAD? {#aead}

-   AEAD stands for "Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data."
-   [Why I have settled on XChaCha20+Blake3 as the AE suite of choice for my proje...](https://archive.is/20211201051906/https://mccarty.io/cryptography/2021/11/29/chacha20-blake3.html)


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Modes??? (ChatGPT generated) {#modes--chatgpt-generated}


#### block {#block}

1.  ****Electronic Codebook (ECB):****
    -   Each block of plaintext is independently encrypted with the same key.
    -   Identical plaintext blocks result in identical ciphertext blocks.

2.  ****Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):****
    -   Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
    -   Initialization Vector (IV) is used for the first block to break patterns.

3.  ****Cipher Feedback (CFB):****
    -   Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.
    -   Previous ciphertext block is fed back into the block cipher to generate a keystream.

4.  ****Output Feedback (OFB):****
    -   Similar to CFB but the block cipher encrypts a constant value (IV) to produce a keystream.
    -   The keystream is then XORed with the plaintext.

5.  ****Counter (CTR):****
    -   Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.
    -   Uses a counter as the input to the block cipher to generate a keystream.
    -   The counter is usually combined with a nonce.

6.  ****Galois/Counter Mode (GCM):****
    -   Combines the counter mode of operation with Galois field multiplication.
    -   Provides both confidentiality and authenticity.
    -   Widely used for authenticated encryption.


#### Stream Cipher Modes: {#stream-cipher-modes}

1.  **Synchronous Stream Ciphers:**
    -   Keyed bits are generated to form a pseudorandom keystream.
    -   The keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.
2.  ****Self-Synchronizing Stream Ciphers:****
    -   Previous ciphertext bits are used to generate the next key bits.
    -   Allows synchronization even if some ciphertext bits are lost or corrupted.
3.  ****Stream Cipher with Feedback (SCFB):****
    -   Similar to CFB mode for block ciphers.
    -   Uses the previous ciphertext bits to generate the next keystream.
4.  ****Combining Generators:****
    -   Multiple keystream generators are combined to improve security.
5.  ****Filter Generators:****
    -   Combines a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with a nonlinear filter.


## Passwords {#passwords}

-   PAKE


### Encrypt passwords? {#encrypt-passwords}

-   Storing passwords HMAC encrypted is technique outdated by at least 10 years


## Cipher {#cipher}

See [Cipher]({{< relref "20230417114522-encryption.md#cipher" >}})

### Forward secrecy {#forward-secrecy}

-   If you lose your key to an attacker today
    -   They still **can’t go** back and read yesterday’s messages
    -   They had to be there with the key yesterday to read them
-   Layman implementation
    -   2 secret keys: a short term session key and a longer-term trusted key.
    -   The session key is ephemeral (usually the product of a DH exchange)
    -   The trusted key signs the session key.
