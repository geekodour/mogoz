## Passwords {#passwords}

-   PAKE


## Forward secrecy {#forward-secrecy}

-   If you lose your key to an attacker today
    -   They still **can’t go** back and read yesterday’s messages
    -   They had to be there with the key yesterday to read them
-   Layman implementation
    -   2 secret keys: a short term session key and a longer-term trusted key.
    -   The session key is ephemeral (usually the product of a DH exchange)
    -   The trusted key signs the session key.
