    -   Example
        -   A front entrance to the east [Pat.4]
        -   A greeting space [Pat.5]
        -   A garden to the west [Pat.26]
        -   Differing floor and ceiling levels [Pat.2]
        -   Daylight and skylight [Pat.16]
        -   Sufficient floor space for working on the floor [Pat.8].
