-   Some pages prerendered, some dynamic
    -   Use any adapter here and then use `export const prerender` as per need per page.
-   Full Static Site Generation
    -   Use `adapter-static` (Skips any `+server.js` related stuff)
-   SPA
    -   Use `adapter-static`
    -   Disable prerender (Use `svelte fallback`)
    -   Disable SSR (When ssr is disabled, its SPA mode)
        -   We can still pre-render individual pages (enable ssr and prerender on those pages)


### About Pre-rendering {#about-pre-rendering}

-   Prerendering means that when we deploy our website, all the `+page/+layout files` javascript is compiled and executed and the resulting static HTML pages are saved.
    -   i.e `page load` functions will be executed and baked into the generated page
    -   Can be used along with `ssr` (altogether or on page-by-page basis)
-   The way prerender works is that it crawls all your rendered pages for links so it can pre-render them all.
-   To tell sveltekit where to find links you that you may not have linked on your pages you should use `entries`


#### When prerender vs ssr? {#when-prerender-vs-ssr}

-   Some pages only have static content, or they fetch content that changes very little over time.
-   If the page keeps on changing we want to be using ssr. (But we don't want to be using sveltekit backend, so we mostly don't want ssr)


### Hydration {#hydration}

-   Interactive javascript is separate from `SSR` and `prerendering`
-   Hydration happens when you're using SSR
-   Term used for loading interactive javascript on your page is `hydration`
-   Happens in the browser and after the page is all rendered
    -   Once the components are fully hydrated, they can react to changes to their properties just like any newly created Svelte component.


### SSR &amp; Static Adapter in Svelte {#ssr-and-static-adapter-in-svelte}

-   See [The missing guide to understanding adapter-static in SvelteKit](https://khromov.se/the-missing-guide-to-understanding-adapter-static-in-sveltekit/)


#### Svelte adapters {#svelte-adapters}

-   You apply the adapter in `svelte.config.js`
-   Adapters are for production/deployment
-   When you use local dev with npm dev, you're doing SSR anyway
-   `adapter-node` runs SSR on a Node server
-   `adapter-netlify` runs SSR in Netlify functions


#### `adapter-static` {#adapter-static}

```file:
export const prerender = false;
export const ssr = false;
```

-   Prerendered routes
    -   We can route to known, prerendered routes
    -   Has associated `.html` file that represents the HTML content for that route.
    -   pre-renders results from any `load()` calls at build time
-   Dynamic routes
    -   We can route to unknown, dynamic routes


## Concepts {#concepts}


### Routing related files {#routing-related-files}

-   Files we have
    -   We have `+layout.svelte|ts|js`
    -   We have `+page.svelte|ts|js`
-   In these files, the variables are not shared unless you use a `load` function and then use `export let data` in `+page.svelte`


### Routing in Svelte {#routing-in-svelte}

-   We could use conditional components but using SvelteKit
    -   with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`
    -   along with disabling SSR is much more straightforward


### Store in Svelte {#store-in-svelte}

-   Types
    -   Readable
    -   Writable
    -   Derived


### State Management in Svelte {#state-management-in-svelte}

-   See [State Management Libraries]({{< relref "20221108105322-state_management_libraries.md" >}}) for [React Framework]({{< relref "20221220014557-react_framework.md" >}}) aswell


#### What's the combo of connect-es, transtackQuery, svelteStore and PageLoad? (when we don't want Selvekit backend features) {#what-s-the-combo-of-connect-es-transtackquery-sveltestore-and-pageload--when-we-don-t-want-selvekit-backend-features}

-   If you're using `connect-es` for [Protocol Buffers]({{< relref "20230522131118-protocol_buffers.md" >}}), it has something called [connectrpc/connect-query-es](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-query-es) which branches of TanStackQuery
    -   Issue is the svelte variant [is not very well supported yet](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-query-es/issues/324)
    -   Because of which we'd want to use connect-web so that we can do rest api calls


#### Other notes {#other-notes}

-   `+page.js` can't use the `$` (autosubscribe) shortcut to access the value from a writable store.
    -   You'll need to explicitly subscribe
    -   Make sure to unsubscribe if not using `$`
-   using `#await` : <https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/124rx4n/sveltekit_when_to_use_load_vs_await/>
