### Declarative {#declarative}

-   A Function
-   "what to do, not how to do it."
-   Functional programming is a subset of declarative programming
-   Declarative programming is to program on a higher level of abstraction than imperative programming. Neither is better or worse, but both have their places.


### Imperative {#imperative}

-   A procedure
-   "How to do it, not what to do
-   Procedural programming is a subset of imperative programming.
