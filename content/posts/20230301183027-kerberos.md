## Intro {#intro}

-   Kerberos is a protocol used to provide authentication to network services
-   Kerberos is typically just authentication.
-   Kerberos separates users, services and hosts
-   Allows pre-authentication and SSO (single sign on)
-   If you worked on a windows environment before and wonder why you never have to type in your password to access a share? Kerberos is the answer. (It replaced NTLM)
-   Many [Directory Services]({{< relref "20230301131822-directory_services.md" >}}) use it for Auth needs
