## Maps {#maps}


### Hashmap {#hashmap}


#### Requirement {#requirement}

-   Stability: Given the same key, your hash function must return the same answer.
-   Distribution: Given two near identical keys, the result should be [wildly different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance).


#### Classical implementation {#classical-implementation}

-   An [array of buckets](https://dave.cheney.net/2018/05/29/how-the-go-runtime-implements-maps-efficiently-without-generics) each of which contains a pointer to an array of key/value entries.
-   Entries are added to a map, assuming a good hash function distribution
-   Once the number of entries across each bucket passes some percentage of their total size(load factor)
    -   The map will grow by doubling the number of buckets
    -   Redistributing the entries across them.
-   Hash(Key) = Hashed_Key =&gt; mask it &amp; get bottom few bits to get bucket offset
