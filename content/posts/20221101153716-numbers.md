> _95% of the [numbers that you](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2lw34c/what_are_you_doing_when_you_take_the_natural_log/) use were invented to solve equations. Probably the least important property of these things, mathematically at least, is their decimal expansion. Their corresponding equations are infinitely more vital._

## Primitives {#primitives}


### Axioms {#axioms}

-   Minimum necessary subset of rules
-   Greek axioma, ‘that which is self evident"

### Theorems {#theorems}

-   We can call the derived rules theorems
-   Greek theorema, “a proposition to be proved”


### Symbols {#symbols}

-   Symbols used in math are contextual
-   Eg. `0x20` means 32 in Hex, but space in ASCII
-   So Symbols without the rules/context mean almost nothing.


## Peano {#peano}


### Peano's Axioms {#peano-s-axioms}

-   1st Axioms were given by Peano. (`S` is Successor Function)
