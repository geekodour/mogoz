## What? {#what}

-   MVCC is **not** a [Concurrency]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}}) control method, It's a technique to achieve Reader/Writer non-locking behavior, we operate on multiple versions of the same record
-   MVCC itself is an umbrella term for its variants (types). MVCC can be combined with [concurrency]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}}) control mechanisms which can be implemented.
-   The DBMS maintains multiple physical versions of a single logical object in the database:
-   If a DB decides to use MVCC, then it'll dictate how the DB handles [transactions]({{< relref "20231113145513-database_transactions.md" >}})
-   Can support time-travel queries


### Main Idea of MVCC {#main-idea-of-mvcc}

-   Readers don’t block Writers
-   Writers don’t block Readers
-   When a txn writes to an object, the DBMS creates a new version of that object.
-   When a txn reads an object, it reads the newest version that existed when the txn started.
-   If 2 txns update the same object/row, then first writer wins. Other rollsback.


### History {#history}

-   First proposed in 1978 MIT PhD dissertation.
-   First implementation was InterBase (Firebird).
-   Used in almost every new DBMS in last 10 years.


### Types of MVCC {#types-of-mvcc}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231116004530-mvcc-1098738115.png" >}}


#### Timestamp Ordering (TO / `MVTO`) {#timestamp-ordering--to-mvto}

-   Assign txns timestamps that determine serial order.
-   Considered to be original MVCC protocol
-   This is what [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) uses


#### Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC / `MVOCC`) {#optimistic-concurrency-control--occ-mvocc}

-   See [Database Locks]({{< relref "20231114211916-database_locks.md" >}})


#### Two Phase Locking (2PL / `MV2PL`) {#two-phase-locking--2pl-mv2pl}

-   See [Two Phase Locking (2PL)]({{< relref "20231116010456-two_phase_locking_2pl.md" >}})


### Version Storage {#version-storage}


#### Append-Only Storage {#append-only-storage}

New versions are appended to the same table space. (What [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) uses)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Version Chain Order

    Basically a singly linked-list.

    -   Oldest-to-Newest `(O2N)`
        -   Just append new version to end of the chain.
        -   Have to traverse chain on look-ups.
        -   [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) uses `O2N`
        -   See [The part of PostgreSQL we hate the most | OtterTune](https://ottertune.com/blog/the-part-of-postgresql-we-hate-the-most)
    -   Newest-to-Oldest `(N2O)`
        -   Have to update index pointers for every new version.
        -   Don’t have to traverse chain on look ups.


#### Time-Travel Storage {#time-travel-storage}

Old versions are copied to separate table space.


#### Delta Storage {#delta-storage}

-   The original values of the modified attributes are copied into a separate delta record space
-   Txns can recreate old versions by applying the delta in reverse order


### Indexes {#indexes}

-   See [Database Indexing]({{< relref "20231113185310-database_indexing.md" >}})
-   Now with the version chain order, we can get to the version we need.
-   But indexes need to point to the tuple aswell.
-   Handling indexes is again involves thinking how MVCC is implemented


#### Primary key index {#primary-key-index}

-   PKey indexes always point to version chain head.
-   How often the DBMS has to update the pkey index depends on whether the system creates new versions when a tuple is updated.
-   If a txn updates a tuple’s pkey attribute(s), then this is treated as an DELETE followed by an INSERT.


#### Secondary Indexes {#secondary-indexes}

-   Logical Pointers
    -   Use a fixed identifier per tuple that does not change.
    -   Requires an extra indirection layer.
    -   Primary Key vs. Tuple Id
-   Physical Pointers
    -   Use the physical address to the version chain head.


## Different Implementations {#different-implementations}

![](/ox-hugo/20231116004530-mvcc-812280423.png)
Implementations differ in Types/Storage/Version chain order etc etc.

-   Oracle
    -   undo log
    -   maintained separately
-   [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}), Spanner use MVCC to see a snapshot(an older version of the database)


## MVCC Implementation in [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) {#mvcc-implementation-in-postgresql--20221102123302-postgresql-dot-md}

-   See [Database Transactions]({{< relref "20231113145513-database_transactions.md" >}}) and [MVCC]({{< relref "20231116004530-mvcc.md" >}})
-   In PG due to its MVCC implementation, `UPDATE` to one field in the row means updating the whole row. See [16: 73.7. Heap-Only Tuples (HOT)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-hot.html)
-   PG handles transaction isolation by using [MVCC]({{< relref "20231116004530-mvcc.md" >}}) to create a concept called `snapshots`
-   One logical row, but can have like multiple physical versions
-   Even if a row is `DELETE` ed, MVCC will store the older version in the same table. Just we won't be able to see it. Later Vaccum will clean it.
-   PostgreSQL maintains this guarantee even when providing the strictest level of transaction isolation through the use of an innovative Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) level. (See [Concurrency Consistency Models]({{< relref "20231113121413-concurrency_consistency_models.md" >}}))


### Lifecycle {#lifecycle}

-   A query(r/w) starts with a [transaction]({{< relref "20231113145513-database_transactions.md" >}})
-   Sees snapshot of the current state of the database. (visibility depends on isolation level, following is `read committed` lifecycle)
    -   If `read` query
        -   There will be no `txid`, only `vtxid`
        -   Sees only data committed before the query began. If data was deleted by another transaction concurrently, it'll still see that data because `snapshot`
        -   Never sees either uncommitted data/changes committed by concurrent transactions
        -   Does see the effects of previous updates executed within its own transaction (committed/uncommitted)
    -   If `write` query
        -   Now the transaction is assigned a `txid`
        -   Record that's being deleted/updated is still retained an version
        -   When trying to write the data it'll either commit or rollback based on `xmin`, `xmax` values and other hints.


### Visibility {#visibility}

```sql
-- think of this implicit WHERE on every row/tuple
-- every row will have xmin
WHERE xmin <= txid_current() AND (xmax = 0 OR txid_current() < xmax)
```


### Transactions {#transactions}

|       | Read-Only | Read-Write | Wrap Around Issue |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| vtxid | Present   | Present    | No                |
| xid   | NULL      | Present    | Yes, Needs VACUMM |


#### Virtual Transaction ID (vtxid / vxid) {#virtual-transaction-id--vtxid-vxid}

-   Temporary identifier assigned to each session or backend that starts a transaction.
    -   `backendID+localXID` : `4/1234`
-   Useful in deadlock detection.
-   Does not need vacuum :)


#### Transaction ID (txid / xid) {#transaction-id--txid-xid}

-   Assigned to a transaction only where there is "write"
-   Earlier transactions having smaller txids(so can be compared)
-   xid are used as the basis for PostgreSQL's [MVCC]({{< relref "20231116004530-mvcc.md" >}}) concurrency mechanism

<!--list-separator-->

-  Circular

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231113145513-database_transactions-1889200249.png" >}}

    -   32bit: 2^32-1 : ~4.2bn
    -   2bn in the past are visible, 2bn in the future are not visible

<!--list-separator-->

-  0,1,2 are reserved

    -   0: Invalid/Nothing happened
    -   1: Initialization of cluster
    -   2: Frozen txid

<!--list-separator-->

-  System Columns

    ![](/ox-hugo/20221102123302-postgresql-1080850089.png)
    ![](/ox-hugo/20221102123302-postgresql-1149627045.png)

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  xmin

        -   `txid` that `INSERT`'ed the tuple
        -   In case of `UPDATE` (`UPDATE` = `DELETE+INSERT`)
            -   `xmin` will be of the `txid` that `UPDATED`'ed the tuple
            -   `xmax` will be set to 0

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  xmax

        ![](/ox-hugo/20221102123302-postgresql-1347060215.png)
        ![](/ox-hugo/20221102123302-postgresql-1813724983.png)
        ![](/ox-hugo/20221102123302-postgresql-1940797856.png)
        ![](/ox-hugo/20221102123302-postgresql-260957505.png)

        -   If we're trying to `write` and we see `xmax` is non-zero: we `ROLLBACK`
            -   i.e in the example, if 519 tries to `write` in that row, it'll have to `ROLLBACK` 519, unless we find that the previous version was rolled back.
            -   i.e If 2 txns update the same object/row, then first writer wins. Other rollsback.
        -   `txid` that `UPDATE/DETELE`
        -   `txid` that `UPDATE/DETELE` + rollback
        -   `0` if nothing happened


#### GID (Global Transaction Identifiers) {#gid--global-transaction-identifiers}

-   `prepared transactions` are also assigned (GID) (See [Two Phase commit (2PC)]({{< relref "20231116010456-two_phase_locking_2pl.md" >}}))
-   NOTE: `prepared transaction` is different from `prepared query` ([SQL]({{< relref "20230217190123-sql.md" >}}))
