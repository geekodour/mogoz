## FAQ {#faq}


### What external servers can be necessary when doing NAT traversal? {#what-external-servers-can-be-necessary-when-doing-nat-traversal}


#### Coordination/Signaling/Rendezvous/side channel server {#coordination-signaling-rendezvous-side-channel-server}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1355531295.png" >}}

-   It solves discovery
-   This is usually managed by the application developer themselves
-   [WebRTC]({{< relref "20230318150409-webrtc.md" >}}) tells you to go home and bring your own signaling channel
-   Eg. [Mainline DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT), Browsers usually use websockets etc, [DCUtR](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/relay/DCUtR.md).
-   See [Bittorrent]({{< relref "20221101190102-bittorrent.md" >}})


#### STUN server {#stun-server}

-   It tells peers what they look like on the internet
-   [RFC 5389: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5389)
-   Eg. STUN/ICE, [AutoNAT](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/autonat)


#### Relay server {#relay-server}

-   Basically something in between that delivers messages from one client to another.
-   It is usually used as a fallbak when peers absolutely can't talk to each other p2p
-   Eg. TURN, simple WebSocket-based relay, [Syncthing Relay Server](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/strelaysrv.html), [DERP Servers](https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers/) (tailscale), [Circuit Relay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/circuit-relay/)


### Can coordination/signaling/rendezvous server &amp; STUN server be same? {#can-coordination-signaling-rendezvous-server-and-stun-server-be-same}

They are not the same, but I guess you could in a way mix them into one if your application/protocol needs be like that. I am not aware of things that do it atm.


### Does NAT only do port mapping? {#does-nat-only-do-port-mapping}

-   It has to create a mapping, may not only be port mapping
-   See [How does a NAT server forward ping ICMP echo reply packets](https://superuser.com/questions/135094/how-does-a-nat-server-forward-ping-icmp-echo-reply-packets-to-users)


## What is the problem? {#what-is-the-problem}

-   NAT by itself is cool and all, decent solution for ipv4 exhaustion when ipv6 not already there imo
-   But problem comes when we want to use it for p2p stuff, cuz w p2p we have this deadlock
    -   Both sides have to speak first
        -   Need to open all the FW on both sides
    -   But neither side knows to whom to speak
        -   Need remote `ip:port` to create a proper `5-tuple` for FW
    -   And can’t know remote `ip:port` until the other side speaks first
        -   Can't know if remote is never able to share its `ip:port` because it needs our `ip:port` too.
-   So the solution(and also the problem) to this is "NAT traversal". And it does not work 100% of the time. But we can try our best + there are fallbacks.


## What do we need? {#what-do-we-need}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-754654042.png" >}}

Final goal: Have UDP packets flowing [bidirectionally]({{< relref "20221101183415-network_programming.md#bidirectional-socket" >}}) between 2 devices.

For this we have:

-   1 socket
-   Initially we'll using the socket to NAT traversal stuff
-   After that we can send out actual data and do whatever
-   It needs to be the same socket, otherwise this cannot happen

For this we need:

-   Protocol needs to be UDP
    -   UDP simply has more success rate
    -   TCP can work but is a hassle because additional handshakes and holepunching needs timing to be right. If you really want streaming data, might go w QUIC. [Bittorrent]({{< relref "20221101190102-bittorrent.md" >}}) uses something called [uTCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol) which is wrapper around UDP.
-   Direct control over socket that'll do network I/O
    -   Data transfer (main protocol) will need to happen through the same socket as the udp socket via which nat travesal will happen


## What do we need to overcome? {#what-do-we-need-to-overcome}


### Stateful Firewalls {#stateful-firewalls}

-   See [Firewalls]({{< relref "20230306125249-firewalls.md" >}})
-   These maintain a state of `5-tuple` (`s_ip:s_port:d_ip:d_port:TCP/UDP`)


#### Common scenario for home network {#common-scenario-for-home-network}

![](/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1101652778.png)
![](/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1288500745.png)

-   This is about how you're able to connect to any website behind a firewall. Same for connecting via VPN. i.e You're behind a firewall and your destination is public.
-   All inbound connections are blocked
-   Once there is a outbound for `d_ip:d_port` from `s_ip:s_port`, packets from `d_ip:d_port` will be allowed.
-   But there are timeouts to this allowing of inbound packets so you need to take measures to like periodically probing etc.


#### P2P scenario {#p2p-scenario}

![](/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1826823353.png)
![](/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-831227797.png)

-   In this case both of the parties are behind a firewall
-   From the common scenario, we know if the timeout has not expired and there exists a `5-tuple` to the `d_ip:d_port`, `d_ip:d_port` will be able to connect to us. We can exploit this.
-   If both the peers know the `ip:port` of each other and use it to open respective firewalls for each other, we have a W.
-   For both peers to know the `ip:port` of each other
    -   We need: Coordination server / Signaling channel
    -   Example: DHT, Tailscale CP
-   We might try sending packets continuously or at some exact specific time etc. Basically if both packets reach each other before FW timeout we are done here.


### NAT Box {#nat-box}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-454769468.png" >}}

-   Usually NAT box is combination of `Stateful Firewall + NAT Box`
-   Nat Box: A Device that modifies L3 header info(`ip:port`) and keeps a record of it.
-   It can do SNAT and DNAT among other things, but we're not worried about DNAT atm. (See [Selfhosting]({{< relref "20230212140130-selfhosting.md" >}}) for info in DNAT). For NAT traversal we're talking only about SNAT.
-   These do "port-mapping" which is stored in something called "NAT table". Basically `internal_ip:internal_port` mapped to `external_ip:external_port`. `external_port` might be same as `internal_port` but we assume it's not to keep things simple and more realistic.


#### Types {#types}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1427109329.png" >}}

Traditionally there [are 4 types](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/6.11.0/knowledge/nat.html) of NATs but it's a little more complicated than that. But for our case of NAT traversal, we only care about if the NAT is [symmetric](https://archive.is/jt4c2) [versus](https://webrtchacks.com/symmetric-nat/) anything else. i.e `EDM` vs `EIM`. EDM and EIM differs on how it does "port-mapping". Described nicely in [RFC 4787](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4787)

EDM (Hard) is basically bad news for NAT traversal.


#### Type: EIM (Easy) {#type-eim--easy}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1509038680.png" >}}

-   Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM)
-   NAT mappings do not depend on destination
-   `external_ip:external_port` for `internal_ip:internal_port` is the same for everyone on the internet.
-   A dog looks like a dog to both you and me. We can say yes that's a dog.


#### Type: EDM (Hard) {#type-edm--hard}

![](/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-2044386205.png)
![](/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-328000419.png)

-   Endpoint-Dependent Mapping (EDM)
-   NAT mappings depend on destination
-   `external_ip:external_port` for `internal_ip:internal_port` is different for different entities on the internet.
-   A dog looks like a dog to me and a cat to you. But atleast we know it's an animal. So we [can guess](https://github.com/danderson/nat-birthday-paradox)


#### Type: EDM (Hard) + Destination Port {#type-edm--hard--plus-destination-port}

-   There's a variant of EDM where mapping varies on destination port change! I call it too hard.


### NAT Box and P2P {#nat-box-and-p2p}


#### We know {#we-know}

-   How to deal w FW for normal and P2P connections
-   That NAT box = FW + L3 header modifier + port mapper
-   Different types of NAT and they port map differently


#### How NAT causes problems for P2P {#how-nat-causes-problems-for-p2p}

-   Now `internal_ip:internal_port` is not how we connect to other systems on the internet when using NAT. We need to know `external_ip:external_port` so that we can let our peer know about it via the coordination server.
-   Problem is, we do not know what is our `external_ip:external_port` because it's per socket and sort of out of our control(in many cases).


### Some solutions to P2P NAT traversal {#some-solutions-to-p2p-nat-traversal}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1858939749.png" >}}


#### Manual/Programatic port mapping {#manual-programatic-port-mapping}

-   If the NAT is in our control we can try manually mapping the `external_ip:external_port` using port mapping software like [upnp]({{< relref "20230508113326-upnp.md" >}}), NAT-PMP, PCP(NAT-PMPv2) etc.
-   This is usually not possible if you're behind a CGNAT


#### Use a STUN server {#use-a-stun-server}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101190313-nat-1097291196.png" >}}

-   A `STUN server` tells the `internal host` what it looks like on the internet. It needs to live outside the NATed network for this.
-   `Internal host` can then provide this info to the `coordination server` so that `other hosts` can use this info to send packets.
-   This generally only works with EMI NAT


#### When STUN server is not enough {#when-stun-server-is-not-enough}

-   With EDM NAT, the info we get from the `STUN server` will be incorrect because the source `ip:port` mapping will differ by destination and `STUN server` and `the peer` we want to talk to are different destinations.
-   Now we need a `Relay server`. TURN is an example of `Relay server`.

### CGNAT {#cgnat}

-   NATs can be good and bad on how they are implemented by the ISPs
-   These are unlike your home NATs.
-   They usually
    -   Are big
    -   Don't allow custom port mapping
    -   Have policies (because carriers run it)
    -   Can block stuff at their will
    -   Limit customers on use of the addresses and ports
    -   f'around with timeouts

### libp2p {#libp2p}

-   This is what IPFS uses under the hood for p2p mechanisms
-   They also have this one: [libp2p + webrtc](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc), I am not sure how that is supposed to work.
-   See [Hole Punching - libp2p](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/hole-punching/)
-   Components
    -   Coordination server: [DCUtR](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/relay/DCUtR.md)
        -   DCUtR is interesting because it claims to not require centralized signalling server unlike most other implementations.
