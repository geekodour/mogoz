### Optimal Use Cases {#optimal-use-cases}


#### WebSockets {#websockets}

-   Real-time chat applications requiring bidirectional communication
-   Live gaming with immediate user interactions
-   Collaborative editing tools needing guaranteed message ordering
-   Financial dashboards with real-time data updates
-   Applications leveraging Cloudflare or similar modern infrastructure
-   Scenarios where sticky sessions and guaranteed message ordering are critical


#### Server-Sent Events (SSE) {#server-sent-events--sse}

-   News feeds and social media timelines
-   Stock tickers and market data displays
-   Status updates and notifications
-   One-way, server-to-client real-time updates
-   Applications where HTTP header support is necessary
-   Scenarios where bidirectional communication is not required


#### HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 {#http-2-or-http-3}

-   REST or GraphQL APIs requiring efficient connections
-   Applications with multiple, parallel data requests
-   Content delivery requiring optimized bandwidth usage
-   Modern web applications without strict real-time requirements
-   Scenarios where standard HTTP semantics are preferred


### Implementation Recommendations {#implementation-recommendations}


#### For WebSockets Implementation {#for-websockets-implementation}

1.  Leverage modern infrastructures like Cloudflare Workers
2.  Focus on use cases requiring persistent, bidirectional connections
3.  Implement custom solutions for authentication limitations
4.  Reserve for scenarios where benefits outweigh engineering challenges
5.  Be prepared for limited future improvements from standards bodies


#### For SSE Implementation {#for-sse-implementation}

1.  Combine with HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for improved performance
2.  Utilize for simpler, server-driven real-time updates
3.  Take advantage of standard HTTP header support for authentication
4.  Consider as primary option for one-way communication needs
5.  Benefit from ongoing standards support and development


### Key Takeaways {#key-takeaways}

WebSockets remain valuable for specific real-time, bidirectional communication needs but suffer from legacy status and lack of development. For many modern use cases, especially those requiring only server-to-client updates, SSE combined with HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 offers a more forward-looking alternative with fewer implementation challenges.

The choice between technologies should be based on specific application requirements, with WebSockets reserved for scenarios where their unique benefits (bidirectional communication, guaranteed ordering, sticky sessions) are essential to functionality, and where modern infrastructure can mitigate their limitations.
