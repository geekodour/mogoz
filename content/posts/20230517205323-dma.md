## FAQ {#faq}


### What basic things to know? {#what-basic-things-to-know}

-   Not all physical memory addresses are "DMA-able".
-   Userspace can't DMA atm. Security issues.
-   Not all devices support DMA


### IS DMA a security issue? {#is-dma-a-security-issue}

-   Yes, a [security problem in a way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1xnpad/how_is_dma_not_a_gaping_security_hole/)
-   IOMMU provides protection by giving permissions to devices on what memory address spaces they can access.


## What? {#what}

-   [An overview of direct memory access | The Infinite Loop](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2014/04/27/an-overview-of-direct-memory-access/)
-   DMA means devices can access physical memory independently of the CPU
-   DMA is rather a concept than a specific technology. There is no specification which describes in detail how DMA transfers work.


### Uses {#uses}

-   Typical application is communicating with peripheral devices plugged into a bus system like ATA, SATA, PCI or PCI Express. (the one we care about atm)
-   intra-core communication in micro processors
-   Copy data from the memory of one computer into the memory of another computer over the network via [remote DMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access)


### Implementation {#implementation}


#### Third party DMA using ISA {#third-party-dma-using-isa}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230517205323-dma-1936077935.png" >}}

-   Bus topology
-   These used DMA controller
-   The DMA controller could be programmed by the CPU to perform a number of memory transfers on behalf of the CPU. This way of accomplishing DMA transfers is also known as third party DMA.


#### PCI DMA {#pci-dma}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230517205323-dma-245335817.png" >}}

-   Introduced bus mustering. No more DMA controllers.
-   i.e only one device at a time to access the bus.
-   The CPU, the DMA controller and bus masters could all be competing for memory access. The memory arbiter typically favors the CPU
-   Compared to DMA controller, with bus mustering devices must contain a `DMA engine` driving the memory transfers.


#### PCIe DMA {#pcie-dma}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230517205323-dma-700080514.png" >}}

-   Star topology, Point-to-Point/Serial.
-   Arbitration by the “root complex”
-   PCIe supports full duplex DMA transfers of multiple devices at the same time.
