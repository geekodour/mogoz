## Products {#products}

Inner product and Outer product are terms from "Geometric Algebra"


### Inner product {#inner-product}

works on abstract vector spaces


#### Dot Product / Scalar product {#dot-product-scalar-product}

-   Intuition
    -   “the amount that two vectors are pushing in the same direction.”
    -   [Dot products and duality | Chapter 9, Essence of linear algebra - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0)
-   Use
    -   Way of turning two vectors into a number in a way that respects how long each vector is and how much the vectors overlap.
    -   Can serve as a measure of how similar two vectors are.
-   Eg.
    -   work is the dot product of force and displacement.
    -   power is the dot product of force and velocity.


### Outer product {#outer-product}


#### Cross product {#cross-product}

-   [Cross products | Chapter 10, Essence of linear algebra - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu6i7WJeinw&t=2s)


### Wedge product {#wedge-product}

-   In differential topology, it works on differential forms and antisymmetrizes them to make a higher degree differential form.
