## What? {#what}

-   Implies supporting of explicit means for transferring control to another coroutine.
-   Coroutine is a chunk of code than can voluntarily suspend itself. i.e yield
-   Coroutines are functions whose execution you can pause


### Transfer of control {#transfer-of-control}

Here, Coroutines have more control compared to exceptions.

```text
Exceptions < Coroutines < Continuations
```

-   Exceptions: A subclass of coroutines. You can implement an exception mechanism with coroutines.
-   Coroutines: Can tell the code to jump back and start running exactly where it left off.
-   Continuations: More [details](https://leafo.net/posts/itchio-and-coroutines.html)


### What happens when we yield? {#what-happens-when-we-yield}

When we `yield`, from the coroutine's point of view

-   Things that happens while it is suspended is happening inside its call to yield.
-   When we resume the coroutine, this call to yield finally returns and the coroutine continues its execution until the next yield or until its end.


### Uses {#uses}

-   Used in RAF
-   I/O and concurrency, see [cooperative multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29#Scheduling).
-   What not

## Taxonomy {#taxonomy}

See [Programming in Lua : 9.1](https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html) (2003)

<div class="warning small-text">

> Note: Avoid using the word "semi-coroutine"
</div>


### Based on control flow {#based-on-control-flow}


#### Symmetric coroutines {#symmetric-coroutines}

-   Only one function to transfer control


#### Asymmetric coroutines {#asymmetric-coroutines}

-   A function to `suspend` the execution of a coroutine
-   A different function to `resume` a `suspended` coroutine.


### Based on when the coroutine can suspend itself {#based-on-when-the-coroutine-can-suspend-itself}


#### Can suspend itself anywhere {#can-suspend-itself-anywhere}

-   Eg. Lua coroutines


#### Can only suspend itself in the main body {#can-only-suspend-itself-in-the-main-body}

-   If there's no pending calls in its control stack
-   Basically each transfer is `yield` followed by a `resume` (in lua terms)
-   Eg. [Python]({{< relref "20221231140207-python.md" >}}) generators. Python generators must be written as generators, and cannot easily be factored into smaller functions. In other words, `yield` is syntactic, and can only be in the lexical body of the generator function.

## Blocking and Non-blocking {#blocking-and-non-blocking}


### Blocking {#blocking}

-   Blocking is about blocking the main thread


#### How to convert from blocking to non-blocking? {#how-to-convert-from-blocking-to-non-blocking}

-   Non-blocking IO depend on "readability/writability"
-   For different IO there are different things that determine it.
-   In case of files, [reading files will always block the main thread](https://www.remlab.net/op/nonblock.shtml). Only solution I know of is to use thread pools, there should be other better options tho ig.


### Non-blocking {#non-blocking}

-   [asynchronous - Refactor blocking I/O in Lua using coroutines - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66283786/refactor-blocking-i-o-in-lua-using-coroutines)
-   Non-blocking is about **not** blocking the main thread
-   So if you write a non-blocking method "fetch" that gets data from across the world, it'll take that time but and make "the caller function" wait, but the main thread will be free to do go on with other stuff.


#### Implementing non-blocking I/O {#implementing-non-blocking-i-o}

-   polling (poll/select etc.)
-   event loop/event handling framework of some sort


## Async/Await {#async-await}

-   Async/Await is slightly different than coroutines. `async/await` is a syntax, whereas coroutine itself is a broader idea. Eg. Many languages use `async/await` to implement coroutines but [not exactly](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5600).
-   Allows asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, and looking almost like traditional synchronous, blocking code.
-   async/await only will switch context at a yield point
