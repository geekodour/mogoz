Cross Origin Request Sharing


## What it is and what not {#what-it-is-and-what-not}


### What it is {#what-it-is}

-   CORS allows to selectively bypass SOP in the browser for network access, loosening our security in the browser, increasing our attack surface area.


### What it's not {#what-it-s-not}

-   It's not a rate limiting mechanism (See [API Design]({{< relref "20230302195820-api_design.md" >}}))
-   Not an origin based auth thing for your API endpoint. non-browser clients will always be able to access your API endpoint.


## How is it implemented? {#how-is-it-implemented}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230302210256-cors-1231826091.png" >}}

-   SOP itself is more than just network access as written previously.
-   CORS allows bypassing [SOP]({{< relref "20230616182504-same_origin_policy_sop.md" >}}) for
    -   cross-domain request read
    -   cross-domain cookie send
    -   cross-domain extra http methods
-   Happens though an agreement b/w browser and server.


### Browser side {#browser-side}

-   [Same Origin Policy (SOP)]({{< relref "20230616182504-same_origin_policy_sop.md" >}}) does allow limited cross-origin requests
-   For cases where it does not allow
    -   It checks `access-control` headers if to allow reads
    -   It uses `preflight` if sever even allows certain things it's going to request


#### How does `preflight` work? {#how-does-preflight-work}

-   This adds additional latency (this is cached by the browser for `access-control-max-age`)
-   It's additional requests, it's extra monie
-   Send an `OPTIONS` to figure out what all methods are allowed by the endpoint. It sends the `OPTIONS` request with these "request" headers.
    ```text
    Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
    Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type
    ```


#### Sending cookies in cross-origin requests {#sending-cookies-in-cross-origin-requests}

-   Usually [Cookies]({{< relref "20230615111924-cookies.md" >}}) / credential stuff is not sent when you make
-   See [XMLHttpRequest: withCredentials property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials)


### Server side {#server-side}

-   It's [HTTP]({{< relref "20230222161545-http.md" >}}) header based
-   Need to configure CORS headers


#### Access control headers {#access-control-headers}

-   `access-control-allow-credentials`: If set, cookies are sent by the browser
-   `access-control-allow-origin`:
    -   Origins allowed to read responses
    -   `*` to allow anyone to make requests.
        -   `allow-credentials` must be unset. Because otherwise it means, anyone from any website will be able to make request to your website aswell as send cookies.
        -   Eg. If `fb.com/secret` had `*` and `allow-credentials` by mistake, you'd be able to have `read` access `fb.com/secret` from any website. This is not allowed.
        -   So if `*` is set, cookies/creds will never be sent.
        -   See [CSRF]({{< relref "20230616090755-csrf.md" >}})
-   `access-control-allow-methods`: HTTP methods allowed


## When use {#when-use}

It's best to avoid [CORS]({{< relref "20230302210256-cors.md" >}}) is possible and let [Same Origin Policy (SOP)]({{< relref "20230616182504-same_origin_policy_sop.md" >}}) do its job. But in certain cases we can't avoid doing CORS.


### When to use? {#when-to-use}

-   When providing an API for third parties to consume from **a browser** (eg. after going through an [OAuth]({{< relref "20230301205620-authorization.md#oauth--open-authorization" >}}) process).


### When not to use? {#when-not-to-use}

-   preflight adds latency, so if we want to cut corners, we do not want to be doing preflights
-   **Only way to eliminate CORS: Have both the frontend and the backend on the same origin.**
-   If `a.bank.com` and `b.bank.com` need access to `api.bank.com`
    -   CORS based solution could be `api.bank.com` allowing origins `a.bank.com` and `b.bank.com`
    -   A better solution could be [using](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) an `API gateway+reverse proxy`. This would avoid CORS altogether.
