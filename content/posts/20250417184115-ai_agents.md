### Definitions {#definitions}

-   LLM on a loop
-   They are fundamentally just programs with a loop structure. Their key characteristic is different modules making decisions about calling tools.
-   Agents begin their work with either a command from, or interactive discussion with, the human user. Once the task is clear, agents plan and operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further information or judgement. During execution, it's crucial for the agents to gain “ground truth” from the environment at each step (such as tool call results or code execution) to assess its progress. Agents can then pause for human feedback at checkpoints or when encountering blockers. The task often terminates upon completion, but it’s also common to include stopping conditions (such as a maximum number of iterations) to maintain control.


#### Patterns {#patterns}

> -   [Building effective agents](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/20/building-effective-agents/)

-   `Prompt chaining`, e.g. generating a document and then translating it to a separate language as a second LLM call
-   `Routing`, where an initial LLM call decides which model or call should be used next (sending easy tasks to Haiku and harder tasks to Sonnet, for example)
-   `Parallelization`, where a task is broken up and run in parallel (e.g. image-to-text on multiple document pages at once) or processed by some kind of voting mechanism
-   `Orchestrator-workers`, where a orchestrator triggers multiple LLM calls that are then synthesized together, for example running searches against multiple sources and combining the results
-   `Evaluator-optimizer`, where one model checks the work of another in a loop


### When? {#when}

-   When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean `not building agentic systems at all`.
-   Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it’s difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can’t hardcode a fixed path.
-   The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments.
-   Do `NOT` invest in complex agent frameworks before you've exhausted your options using direct API access and simple code.
