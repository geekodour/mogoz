Basically the challenge is to transfer zeros and ones into waveforms.

You can control the amplitude(_How strong is a signal_), and the Frequency.


## Shannon capacity theorem {#shannon-capacity-theorem}

It tells the **maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel** of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise. Depending on how good my encoding(converting bits into waveforms) is, one can approach some fraction of the Shannon limit.

## ISM(industrial, scientific and medical) bands {#ismindustrial-scientific-and-medical-bands}

The use of frequency is regulated by the governments. The ISM radio bands are portions of the radio spectrum(RF spectrum) reserved internationally for industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) purposes **other than telecommunications.** cordless phones, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC and a host of other short range wireless applications use the ISM band. You don't need a license to operate in the ISM bands.
