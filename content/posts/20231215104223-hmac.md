## FAQ {#faq}


### What is MAC? {#what-is-mac}

-   A commonly employed technique for message integrity and authentication in various cryptographic protocols and applications.
-   A cipher may be used for [Encryption]({{< relref "20230417114522-encryption.md" >}}) but it does not ensure [Authentication]({{< relref "20230301191046-authentication.md" >}}) or `Integrity`. Using a MAC ensures those two.


#### Types {#types}

-  Block cipher based MAC

    -   Although GHASH and Poly1305 are secure MACs, theyâ€™re not built from cryptographic hash functions.

-  Hash based MAC (HMAC)


## More on HMAC {#more-on-hmac}

-   It's useful for streaming ciphers
-   HMAC is a recipe for turning hash functions into MACs.
-   HMAC is a very specific construct, namely `H(K1||H(K2||M))` with usually a simple rule to generate K1 and K2 from a single K.
-   You do have to be careful with naive HMAC if you don't use the construction like the official HMAC `H(K1(H(K2(m)))` as the simpler attempt at a keyed hash based MAC `H(K1(m))` will be vulnerable to length-extension attacks for many hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-2)
-   HMAC derives from NMAC which used a hash with two different keys. They then proved that related keys would be just as strong [hence hmac].


### HMAC vs SHA3/Blake3 etc. {#hmac-vs-sha3-blake3-etc-dot}

-   Some newer hashing techniques hash with a key that's safe to use as a MAC (and acts as a PRF) so we don't need to do the double hashing that HMAC does.
-   With newer `SHA3` candidate hash algorithms `(Keccak, Skein, Blake etc)`, length extension attacks are a thing of the past, you can simply do `H(K, M)` for a secure MAC. It's much simpler and faster than doing something like `HMAC-SHA-256(K, M)`
-   This makes these hashing techniques equivalent to HMAC but they are not HMAC. i.e HMAC is a particular standard, not any hash-based MAC.
