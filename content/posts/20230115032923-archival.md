#### IA (Internet Archive) {#ia--internet-archive}

-   Archive Team is a loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage.
-   archive.is launched in 2012.


#### Z-library {#z-library}

-   Z-Library was essentially a clone of LibGen with a more accessible UX and monetization. Though I believe they eventually solicited new material that was not fed back into LibGen.
-   Basically libgen has more strict requirements on metadata, fiction/non fiction split, so it makes meeting difficult.
