## Overview {#overview}

-   Time &amp; State: <https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2745385> (There is No Now)
-   Logical clocks, vector clocks, hybrid logical clocks, snapshots
    -   They form the basis of
        -   [crdt]({{< relref "20230607045339-crdt.md" >}})
        -   version vectors in NoSQL databases
        -   snapshot reads and commits in distributed SQL databases build upon.

## To read {#to-read}

-   “relativity means there is no such thing as simultaneity” used as an argument that synchronized clocks cannot exist.
    -   This is a misunderstanding
        -   the equations of special and general relativity provide exact equations for time transformations, and it is possible to define any number of sensible, globally-synchronized time clocks.
        -   Consistency constraints that refer to these clocks will depend on the choice of clock
            -   e.g. depending on one’s reference frame, a system might or might not provide linearizability. See [Concurrency Consistency Models]({{< relref "20231113121413-concurrency_consistency_models.md" >}})
        -   The good news is that
            -   For all intents and purposes, clocks on earth are so close to each other’s velocities and accelerations that errors are much smaller than side-channel latencies
            -   Many of the algorithms for ensuring real-time bounds in asynchronous networks use causal messages to enforce a real-time order, and the resulting order is therefore invariant across all reference frames.

## Timestamps and Databases {#timestamps-and-databases}

-   I can't find the original post now, but there's a good suggestion that booleans should usually be timestamps
    -   UPDATE orders SET deletion_timestamp = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() WHERE deletion_timestamp IS NULL
