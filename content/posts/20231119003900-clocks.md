## To read {#to-read}

-   “relativity means there is no such thing as simultaneity” used as an argument that synchronized clocks cannot exist.
    -   This is a misunderstanding
        -   the equations of special and general relativity provide exact equations for time transformations, and it is possible to define any number of sensible, globally-synchronized time clocks.
        -   Consistency constraints that refer to these clocks will depend on the choice of clock
            -   e.g. depending on one’s reference frame, a system might or might not provide linearizability. See [Concurrency Consistency Models]({{< relref "20231113121413-concurrency_consistency_models.md" >}})
        -   The good news is that
            -   For all intents and purposes, clocks on earth are so close to each other’s velocities and accelerations that errors are much smaller than side-channel latencies
            -   Many of the algorithms for ensuring real-time bounds in asynchronous networks use causal messages to enforce a real-time order, and the resulting order is therefore invariant across all reference frames.

### Part 1: Time - Abstract Concept in Distributed Systems {#part-1-time-abstract-concept-in-distributed-systems}


#### Fundamental Time Concepts {#fundamental-time-concepts}

-   Time as a partial ordering of events in distributed systems
-   Formal definition of concurrent events: events that are neither "happened before" nor "happened after" each other
-   Synchrony models and their precise definitions:
    -   Synchronous: bounded message delay and bounded process execution speed
    -   Asynchronous: unbounded message delay and/or process execution speed
    -   Partially synchronous: eventually bounded message delay and process execution speed
-   The impossibility of perfect global time in distributed systems (theoretical proof)


#### Causality and Ordering {#causality-and-ordering}

-   Lamport's happens-before relation (→): formal definition and properties
    -   If a and b are events in the same process, and a occurs before b, then a → b
    -   If a is the sending of a message and b is the receipt of that message, then a → b
    -   If a → b and b → c, then a → c (transitivity)
-   Concurrent events: a ∥ b ⟺ ¬(a → b) ∧ ¬(b → a)
-   Causal history: C(e) = {e' | e' → e} ∪ {e}
-   Formal proof that causality establishes a partial, not total, order


#### Consistency Models Based on Time Ordering {#consistency-models-based-on-time-ordering}

-   Linearizability: formal definition as a history H that can be extended to a history H' such that:
    -   Complete(H') is equivalent to some legal sequential execution S
    -   If op1 completes before op2 begins in H, then op1 appears before op2 in S
-   Sequential consistency: formal definition and distinction from linearizability
-   Causal consistency: formal definition using happens-before relation
-   PRAM consistency (Pipelined RAM): formal definition
-   Eventual consistency: formal definition including convergence, conflict resolution


#### Time in Coordination Problems {#time-in-coordination-problems}

-   Time's role in the Two Generals Problem (formal impossibility proof)
-   Time assumptions in the Byzantine Generals Problem
-   Time's role in distributed deadlock detection
-   Formal treatment of timeouts as imperfect failure detectors
-   Time and leader election (impossibility in purely asynchronous systems)


#### The FLP Impossibility Result {#the-flp-impossibility-result}

-   Precise statement of the FLP result: In an asynchronous system with even one faulty process, there is no deterministic algorithm that solves consensus
-   Detailed analysis of time's role in this impossibility
-   Implications for real-world distributed system design
-   Connection to other impossibility results (CAP theorem, Two Generals)


### Part 2: Clocks - Mechanisms for Tracking Time {#part-2-clocks-mechanisms-for-tracking-time}


#### Physical Clock Systems {#physical-clock-systems}

#### Logical Clocks {#logical-clocks}

-   Lamport clocks:
    -   Formal definition: C(a) &lt; C(b) if a → b
    -   Clock update rules:
        -   Before executing an event, process Pi increments Ci: Ci = Ci + 1
        -   When sending a message m, process Pi sets m's timestamp ts(m) = Ci
        -   Upon receiving message m, process Pj sets Cj = max(Cj, ts(m)) + 1
    -   Limitations: possibility of C(a) &lt; C(b) when a ∥ b
-   Lamport timestamps as an implementation of monotonic time
-   Mathematical proof that Lamport clocks capture causal precedence but not concurrency


#### Vector Clocks {#vector-clocks}

-   Vector clock formal definition: VC(e) = [t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ] where tᵢ represents local logical time at process i
-   Vector clock rules:
    -   Initially, VC[j] = 0 for all j
    -   Before each event at process i: VC[i] = VC[i] + 1
    -   When sending a message m, process i includes current VC with m
    -   When process j receives message m from process i with vector timestamp VC_m:
        -   VC[k] = max(VC[k], VC_m[k]) for all k ≠ j
        -   VC[j] = VC[j] + 1
-   Comparison of vector timestamps: VC(a) &lt; VC(b) iff ∀k: VC(a)[k] ≤ VC(b)[k] and ∃k: VC(a)[k] &lt; VC(b)[k]
-   Mathematical proof that vector clocks accurately capture both happens-before and concurrent relationships
