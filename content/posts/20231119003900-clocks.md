-   “relativity means there is no such thing as simultaneity” used as an argument that synchronized clocks cannot exist.
    -   This is a misunderstanding
        -   the equations of special and general relativity provide exact equations for time transformations, and it is possible to define any number of sensible, globally-synchronized time clocks.
        -   Consistency constraints that refer to these clocks will depend on the choice of clock
            -   e.g. depending on one’s reference frame, a system might or might not provide linearizability.
        -   The good news is that
            -   For all intents and purposes, clocks on earth are so close to each other’s velocities and accelerations that errors are much smaller than side-channel latencies
            -   Many of the algorithms for ensuring real-time bounds in asynchronous networks use causal messages to enforce a real-time order, and the resulting order is therefore invariant across all reference frames.
