## Intro {#intro}

-   [Different formalisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/tlaplus/comments/n7mj3u/can_formal_methods_succeed_where_uml_failed/) often have different ergonomics when it comes to different particular systems and properties, and the matter of personal aesthetic preference also plays a big role.
-   At the end of the day, many those formalisms have similar expressivity (i.e., they can describe roughly the same set of systems and the same set of properties)


## Theorem Provers and Formal Spec Tools {#theorem-provers-and-formal-spec-tools}

-   Formal [Logic]({{< relref "20230925154135-logic.md" >}}) : `formal specification (description)` + `formal proof`
-   Writing `formal specification` is different skillset from writing `formal proofs`.
-   You can write `formal specification` without knowing how to write `formal proof`

### Formal specification first {#formal-specification-first}


#### Temporal Logic of Action(TLA+) {#temporal-logic-of-action--tla-plus}

-   Good for specification of `order`
-   TLA+ is a modelling/specification language for computational processes.
-   Lamport's hypothesis was that a programming language, no matter how simple, is still much more complicated and far less expressive than simple mathematics.
-   Time is viewed as discrete (rather than continuous), considers branching time (as opposed to linear time) and in which time branches only into the future (and not into the past).
-   Can be use to prove Paxos and Raft
-   Can support Model checkers like Z3
