## Intro {#intro}

-   [Different formalisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/tlaplus/comments/n7mj3u/can_formal_methods_succeed_where_uml_failed/) often have different ergonomics when it comes to different particular systems and properties, and the matter of personal aesthetic preference also plays a big role.
-   At the end of the day, many those formalisms have similar expressivity (i.e., they can describe roughly the same set of systems and the same set of properties)

### TLA+ {#tla-plus}

-   TLA+ is a modelling/specification language for computational processes.
-   Lamport's hypothesis was that a programming language, no matter how simple, is still much more complicated and far less expressive than simple mathematics.
-   Time is viewed as discrete (rather than continuous), considers branching time (as opposed to linear time) and in which time branches only into the future (and not into the past).
-   Can be use to prove Paxos and Raft

-   Can support Model checkers like Z3


## Lambda calculus based {#lambda-calculus-based}

These are interactive theorem provers


### Lean {#lean}

-   Lean is a FP language and theorem prover that compiles to C
-   Lean's maths library is completely focused on classical mathematics
