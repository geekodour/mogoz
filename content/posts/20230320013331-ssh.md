## Intro {#intro}

A cryptographic network protocol that laregly uses PKI to do its job

-   Transport layer: Server auth, integrity check
-   User auth: validates client to the server
-   Connection protocol: multiplexes the encrypted tunnel


### Applications {#applications}

-   Remote login/passwordless login
-   Remote execution
-   Tunneling (different from a vpn, can also be a vpn)
-   Port forwarding
-   Used in file transfer programs
-   Forwarding x win
-   Web-browsing through encrypted proxy (SOCKS)
-   Mounting remote filesystem locally (SSHFS)
-   others.


### OpenSSH {#openssh}

-   One of the most popular and widely used implementations.
-   This originally gets built for OpenBSD. The portability team does the work of making it support other operating systems.


### How fingerprinting happens {#how-fingerprinting-happens}

-   Public key is always derived from the private key, so in essence if you have the private key you would know the public key.
-   Usual way how fingerprints are constructed is, the fingerprint is constructed out of the public part of the private key. Because of this the fingerprint of either private or public key of a key pair is the same.
-   See [Checking ssh public key fingerprints](https://www.phcomp.co.uk/Tutorials/Unix-And-Linux/ssh-check-server-fingerprint.html#:~:text=In%20openssh%20)


### host and user keys {#host-and-user-keys}

-   Host keys
    -   Server keys
    -   Generated when openssh is installed. Keys of different types are generated at `/etc/ssh` (Only root access)
    -   Identical to the user-keys. `ssh-keygen` can be used to replace existing host keys.
-   user keys
    -   Per user
    -   Private keys are accessible by the root+user


## ssh-agent {#ssh-agent}

<div class="warning small-text">

> You can't really differentiate an encrypted private key from a non-encrypted one from human eye. But anyway if its encrypted, the client will ask you for a passphrase to decrypt the private key. (i have to verify this lol)
</div>

-   When we generate key pairs, we can decide to encrypt the private key with a passphrase. (It's good practice to do so)
-   If the case you decide to encrypt the private key, you might want to use `ssh-agent` because otherwise youâ€™ll just have to give the passphrase every time you want to make use of the private key. It keeps the private key in [memory](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/network-penetration-testing/stealing-unencrypted-ssh-agent-keys-from-memory/)(unencrypted). It does not write anything to disk, it does not export the private key.
-   Private keys stored in ssh-agent can only be used for one purpose, signing a message. (This statement is [controversial](https://smallstep.com/blog/ssh-agent-explained/) from the [key challenge](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html) section where it uses the private key to decrypt)


## SSH Handshake {#ssh-handshake}


### Server Auth {#server-auth}

-   Client tries to connect to server
-   Server responds with is public key
-   Using PKI, client verifies that the public key infact belongs to the server
-   This authenticates the server
-   Finally the client will check if the server is listed in the known_hosts file, and add it there if not upon prompt


### User auth {#user-auth}

Now user auth is one of the application but probably the most common one. Technically once the server auth is done, we could possibly be doing anything. Following is how the user auth happens:

1.  first it is ensured that weâ€™re connecting to the correct server using server auth
2.  user auth happens through the key challenge
    1.  server creates a random no. and encrypts it using the users public key
    2.  userâ€™s ssh-agent decrypts the random no. because it has the private key. It prepares `md5(ssh_session_id + decrypted random no.)` and sends it back to the server
    3.  this way, the random number is never goes to the wire directly(this is intentional)

Itâ€™s called the key challenge


## Agent Forwarding {#agent-forwarding}

-   [SSH Agent Forwarding considered harmful (2015) | Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/w5ssrg/ssh_agent_forwarding_considered_harmful)  : Read this first
-   It's basically a trick and done via an environment variable. the private key is never forwarded but the agent itself is forwarded to the jump server in a forwarding mode.
-   Basically, as client receives key challenges, the agent will forward these challenges upstream to our local machine, where the challenge response will be constructed via a locally stored private key and forwarded back downstream to the destination server for authentication.


### How it works {#how-it-works}

-   SSH connections can have multiple channels, in this case,
    -   Connecting channel
    -   Forwarding channel
-   Essentially forwarding the `ssh-agent` unix domain socket to the remote host. `sshd` on the remote host does the following:
    -   `sshd` on remote creates a unix domain socket linked to the `agent forwading channel`
    -   `sshd` on remote sets `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to it. Now, `ssh` just looks at `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` for the `ssh-agent` and it tries to use it

<div class="warning small-text">

> If an attacker has root access to the remote host, they can simply set their `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to the address the `victim user`'s forwarding unix socket and they can essentially impersonate them on the network.
</div>


### Caution and Warnings {#caution-and-warnings}

-   Use SSH agent forwarding only on machines we truly trust. i.e donâ€™t turn ssh agent forwarding by default. i.e User agent forwarding based on session basis using `ssh -A` instead of putting it in config.
-   You can also lock your agent with a password using `ssh-add -x`
-   Instead of Agent forwarding, use ProxyJump


## Bastion host/Gateway host/JumpBox {#bastion-host-gateway-host-jumpbox}

<div class="warning small-text">

> There's a term bastion service, it's nothing but marketing bs
</div>

-   An alternative to SSH agent forwarding
-   `ProxyJump` forwards the standard io of your local SSH client through the bastion and on to the remote host. Agent forwarding does not take place, `sshd` connects to the remote host and gives the local machine the connection
-   Multiple jump hosts can be specified
-   Bastion hosts in [general can be used](https://thecurve.io/securing-your-cloud-with-a-bastion-host/#:~:text=Increasing%20security%3A%20using%20a%20Bastion%20host&text=This%20is%20a%20more%20secure,the%20cloud%20network%20against%20attack.) for more things than SSH and they also help in compliance


## Things I keep hearing about {#things-i-keep-hearing-about}
