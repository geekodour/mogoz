## Some ideas {#some-ideas}

-   Research on how to design better syllabus. Not just how to design better syllabus. Eg. Textbook on new accepted things like equality for gay things in school etc. even if those things are not in textbook one receiving an education must realize. Then our social future is not very strong because otherwise we cannot like guarantee that it'll be kind of the same. This is not trying to control concurrency, this is trying to control where the data flows. Basically see what will help design better syllabus, what tools will help, how should they be used to make it better etc.
-   Syllabus is important because otherwise collecting knowledge from the internet not an easy task, moreover it is distracting for how the human mind works. Unless we adapt to make our mind defend against the distracting nature of the internet.
-   Students themselves can improve their syllabus/books based on the difficulties that they faced, this will help their juniors. This will be really cool because we'll get very local additions and examples that everyone will be able to understand and challenges one size fits all model in a new way. (eg. juniors don't have to go through the same understanding struggle, instead of one student maintaining some good notes, why not share it with everyone.)
-   Mediums: Magazines, books, digests, videos, podcasts, listening to other people, workshops, thinking, exploring your own mind, images, activities/realizations, animations, drama, music more.
-   need to do this with other things. education books should be made more local so that kids can directly go experiment. learning can be of different envs, like local, staging, prod. local they learn about their local surrounding, then they learn about the country etc. but fr, since they are physical things the most important thing they should be aware of is the local thing and how it is affected by the other envs unlike in computers
