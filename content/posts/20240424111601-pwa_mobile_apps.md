## PWA resources {#pwa-resources}

### Capacitor {#capacitor}

> The biggest advantage Capacitor brings is full native access and app store distribution. Yes, PWAs can do a lot, but they

> -   Can't use the massive ecosystem of third-party native SDKs. Capacitor can.
> -   Can't be distributed on iOS in the app store. Capacitor apps can.

> So, if those things matter to you, Capacitor is the way to go. You can build your app such that you're building a PWA first but then "enhancing" it with native Capacitor plugins or custom native code. The decision is not either/or because Capacitor was built to enable PWAs to run natively with almost 100% code sharing on the web.

-   Capacitor is PWA on steroids
-   It's not “native native” but it’s more than “good enough” for most types of apps.
-   Capacitor allows for certain features that are only available on native and not PWA. For example, local notifications

## Gotchas of PWA {#gotchas-of-pwa}

-   You cannot directly publish a PWA in the App Store, but you can wrap it with Capacitor and publish that.
-   Push notifications are not very well supported
-   Capacitor
    -   you’ll have a hard time replicating native modals, sheets and navigation stacks. i speak from experience, as i’ve recently given up on using capacitor because implementing swipe to go back is a hacky deep hole.


## Others {#others}

-   There's reactive native and <https://svelte-native.technology/> etc. and then there's PWA.
-   Quickest to MVP is PWA.
-   I'd prefer doing MVP with PWA and then if things takeoff get some dedicated swift and flutter dev to make for android and ios.
-   There's also <https://www.pwabuilder.com/> which is probably capacitor alternative
