It is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats **actor** as the fundamental unit of computation. Actors usually come in systems.


## What makes an Actor? {#what-makes-an-actor}

-   **Processing**: Getting something done
-   **Storing**: Ability to store/ use memory
-   **Communicating**: Ability to communicate (have an address)


## What can an Actor do? {#what-can-an-actor-do}

-   Create more actors.
-   Send messages to actors that it knows.
-   Designate how it will deal with the next message that is sent to itself.
    -   Eg. You have ₹5 and someone sends you ₹6 after sometime, so next time you need to do some transaction you'll be using ₹11 and not ₹5 as your balance.

### Future {#future}

Future is a special actor, you can create an actor for any result while the result is being computed and you can keep passing that result around or store it.


### Identity and Address {#identity-and-address}

```text
identity != address
```

-   There can be one **address** for a whole bunch of **actors**
-   One **actor** can have multiple **addresses**

We cannot tell if there is one actor or multiple actors behind a given address. **All you can do with an address is send it a message.** The integrity of addresses is to be maintained to ensure capability.


### Communication {#communication}

The communication happens directy(eg. `put`,=get=); there is no channel involved. If in case you want to implement sequencing you can create `futures` and send the sequence to the reciever actor and they later can manifest it if needed.

Messages gets delivered **at most** once. If you send 3 messages to the **same** actor, it will just execute one at a time. To have these 3 messages being executed concurrently, you need to create 3 actors and send one message to each.


### Non-determinism and Indeterminism {#non-determinism-and-indeterminism}

-   **Nondeterministic**: [Nondeterministic Turing machines(NTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_Turing_machine) have only bounded nondeterminism.
-   **[Indeterminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbounded_nondeterminism)**: When things are decided based on how things worked out. Hewitt tries to justify unbounded non-determinism based on the idea of [arbiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)) as you could not tell how long it would take the arbiter to make its decision.

>     -   we can predict the ordering
> -   w arbiter: 2 inputs and gives 1 only one output
>     -   input: i1,i2 will give output: o2 or o2
>     -   we cannot predict the ordering

> This result is of considerable practical importance, as **multiprocessor** computers would not work reliably without it. The first multiprocessor computers date from the late 1960s, predating the development of reliable arbiters.
>
> Erlang message passing say pretty much the same thing: whenever two processes send a message each to a third process, and there is no ordering constraint on the individual send events, you can never rely on which message will end up first in the receiver's mailbox.

### Programming Languages {#programming-languages}

There is an art to making programming languages for actors, very easy to screw it up. `Erlang` is probably one of the most famous languages that uses Actor model.


### Why we should not try to force consistency in our world {#why-we-should-not-try-to-force-consistency-in-our-world}

-   We can't
-   We don't know much and some of it is wrong. (schrodinger cat)
