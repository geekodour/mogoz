These are notes from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAofPy-QkkA) , while I was trying to learn how to use linear for a project I am working on.


## General {#general}

-   linear is a issue tracker but the problem it tries to solve is project
    management which is the real problem companies face
-   usually other project management tools are made for any projects, linear is specifically made for software companies
-   existing tools felt like the user was fighting against them, don't feel like they are supporting your workflow, more like you're just recording things to generate a report later
-   Craft x Impact = Great products
    -   Some people start measuring things too early. There are things we should measure like is the needle moving or no. But sometimes quality might not be measurable yet.
    -   Craft: Quality, Interactions, Design, Brand, Delight, Ease, Clarity, Animations
    -   Impact: Usefulness, Moving the needle, metrics, user value, business value, Strategy, focus
-   Concentrate on what will produce results rather than on the results, the process rather than the prize. The score takes care of itself.
    -   Sometimes teams try to measure too much
    -   Sometimes they'll focus too much how they work
    -   If you build a team which values the right things, they should produce the right kind of results


## Principles (applies to linear) {#principles--applies-to-linear}

-   Build for creators
    -   Sometimes companies build product for the buyers and not for the end-users, linear does not do that
-   Opinionated software
    -   vs Flexible software. There is always some trade off.
    -   Linear feels like there are certain ways which produces best results
-   Create momentum, don't sprint
-   Meaningful direction
-   Aim for clarity
-   Say no to "busy work"
-   Simple first, then powerful
-   Decide and move on


## How they do it {#how-they-do-it}

-   They try to keep the project at max 4 weeks and not months.

<!--listend-->

-   They apply theme for the Quarter : What is the next step we trying to get to
-   10 people run linear(the entire team)
    -   6 eng (Also do design)
    -   2 PM
    -   1 Recruiter
    -   1 Contract
-   Product so good that people will use it anyway
-   Not focusing on educating users as of the moment but they feel they can be more helpful


## Features {#features}

-   Cycles help you stay focused on the work for the week, changing directions too much is not good
-   They don't care about how many points they're making but they care about if they're making progress


## Notes for myself {#notes-for-myself}

-   Different projects should go as different workspaces, teams should go as teams, bigger tasks should go as projects
