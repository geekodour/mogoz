Logs give us context into the long tail that averages and percentils don't surface.


## Writers/Sources {#writers-sources}


### systemd journal {#systemd-journal}

-   `systemd` needs to be there
-   `systemd` services. When they log to `stderr` / `stdout`, `journald` picks them up and writes them in binary format into it's journal.
-   Usually stored in `/var/log/journal` in binary, use `journalctl` to view
-   `journald` can forward all its messages to `syslog` if needed


### syslog {#syslog}

-   Usually the case when there's no `systemd`
-   Services can write to `/dev/log` in the `syslog` format
-   A syslog daemon(eg. `rsyslog`, `syslog-ng`) picks it and writes it to destinations(could be file/others)
-   By default writes `files` to `/var/log`
-   Because it's file based, we'll probably need to use something like `logrotate`
-   History
    -   `syslog` project first. It started in 1980. Birthed the syslog protocol. UDP only.
    -   `syslog-ng` came in 1998. TCP support, encryption etc.
    -   `rsyslog` came in 2004. Extends `syslog-ng`


### kernel {#kernel}

-   Writes its own logs to a ring buffer.
-   `journald` or `syslog` daemons  can read logs from this buffer then write to `files` or `journal`
-   `dmesg` can be used to view these
-   **Audit Logs**: [Special case](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Audit_framework) of kernel messages designed for auditing actions such as file access. Probably can [be replaced](https://goteleport.com/blog/linux-audit/) by BPF.


## Applications {#applications}


### Logging to `stdout` / `stderr` {#logging-to-stdout-stderr}

-   [Logging: The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/logs)

On systems with systemd...

-   if you write to stderr/stdout and is running with systemd it will log to systemd-journal. That's just the way it works.
-   More and more, I think the only time you want your program dealing with log files directly is if you have a need for specific multiple logs. But even then, it seems like adding labels or tags to your log stream would be the better.
-   Even in non-containerized apps, it seems writing to stdout/stderr is the way to go these days. If it's something designed to be daemonized, letting whatever executes the process (systemd for example) can be told where to send the logs, defaulting to a common location like /var/log/syslog. If it's running inside a docker container or k8s, they have their own way to send logs.


### Language specifics {#language-specifics}

-   For [Python]({{< relref "20221231140207-python.md" >}}), std logging goes a long way, additionally I like `structlog`
-   For [Golang]({{< relref "20221101220915-golang.md" >}}), there's Zap, there logurus and few more. But now we have a standard in Go1.21m its called slog.
    -   It sort of follows the port-adapter pattern using `Handlers` (See [Design Patterns]({{< relref "20221125204047-design_patterns.md" >}}))
    -   slog ships w JSON and logfmt handlers. But 3rd party handlers are also supported: zap/logurus etc


### How? {#how}

-   It needs to be async, don't block main thread for logging
-   Prefer structured logging if not intended for tty


#### Sampling {#sampling}

-   Not sampling means more storage
-   Sampling means it'll cost cpu cycles to sample and trim things down.
-   We can adjust the sample rate based on traffic etc.
-   Types
    -   `Head / Ingestion`: The first service in the request chain can make the decision about whether to trace, which can reduce tracing overhead on services further down.
    -   `Tail / Index`: The tracing backend can make a determination about whether to persist the trace after the trace has been collected. This has tracing overheads, but allows you to make decisions like “always keep errors”.


#### Redaction {#redaction}

-   Remove sensitive info
-   This can be done inside the application but that doesn't guarantee that it'll never leak, deps, someone forgetting etc.
-   The other way is to redact outside the application with regex or using custom stuff [like Ragel](https://ekhabarov.com/post/ragel-state-machine-compiler/) etc.)


## Centralized logging {#centralized-logging}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20221101183142-logging-2022004175.png" >}}


### Log collector {#log-collector}

-   `journald`
-   `syslog-ng` / `rsyslogd` (RELP if requires delivery guarantee)


### Log routers/ log processors {#log-routers-log-processors}

People call these by different names.

-   Examples: `journald-upload`, Fluend, Logstash, Filebeat, Promtail


### Central logging/ storage/query {#central-logging-storage-query}

-   ELK stack, BigQuery, Graylog, splunk, datadog, Loki etc.
-   [Sending logs from syslog-ng to Grafana Loki](https://www.syslog-ng.com/community/b/blog/posts/sending-logs-from-syslog-ng-to-grafana-loki)


## Practices {#practices}


### Canonical Log Line {#canonical-log-line}

-   Resist emitting random logs throughout the request as this makes analysis difficult.
-   A canonical log line is a log emitted at the end of the request with everything that happened during the request. This makes querying the logs bliss.
-   See [Fast and flexible observability with canonical log lines](https://stripe.com/blog/canonical-log-lines)
