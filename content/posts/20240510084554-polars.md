## User defined functions (UDF) {#user-defined-functions--udf}

-   Whenever possible we want to avoid this.
-   See this for why: <https://docs.pola.rs/py-polars/html/reference/dataframe/api/polars.DataFrame.map_rows.html#polars.DataFrame.map_rows>
    -   We can play around with the native stuff to get most things done.

-  Predicate pushdown (Row)

    -   It seems like predicate pushdown when downloading from s3 is not yet properly supported.
        -   "This might be a separate issue but seems related: Polars doesn't yet support predicate pushdown into datasets nor streaming output. It eagerly calls to_table() on them instead. Both DataFusion and DuckDB can query datasets lazily with predicate pushdown; it would be nice if Polars did too."

## polars, loops, partitions, delta merges and python memory management {#polars-loops-partitions-delta-merges-and-python-memory-management}

Issues:

-   Memory release
    -   polars doesn't release memory
    -   python doesn't release memory
    -   parquet row groups also matter (think for us this is handled by DL)
    -   How allocation works with polars and python, this is expected

-   Memory load
    -   delta-rs merge doesn't seem to take partitioning info

What to do?

-   We should focus more on reducing the memory load part of it, last resort if we're not able to release memory we can restart and it's a python/polars problem
-   Loading not needed data into memory is a delta-rs issue that we need to fix
