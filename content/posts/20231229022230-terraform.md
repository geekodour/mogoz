## FAQ {#faq}


### Ansible vs Terraform {#ansible-vs-terraform}

Ansible can accomplish the same type of infrastructure provisioning as Terraform. Usually these can co-exist as they serve different purposes.

-   Ansible
    -   Is an imperative script execution engine that will run tasks in the order listed in the code
-   Terraform
    -   Is a declarative execution engine that will parallelize tasks that don't directly depend on each other. (So can be faster)
    -   graph-based nature also makes it possible to destroy infrastructure with the exact same code you used to create it. (Useful for environments such as staging/dev etc. which need infra re-provisioningg)


## Intro {#intro}

-   Useful for stateful infrastructure as code.


### Usecase {#usecase}

-   TF should be infra provisioning only
-   TF [not to be used](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro/vs/chef-puppet) for config provisioning/management, for config management we got [Ansible]({{< relref "20230319123221-ansible.md" >}}). Both can co-exist.
-   We can use `cloud-init` (See [LXC &amp; LXD]({{< relref "20230223110853-lxc.md" >}})) for initial provisioning, that needs to be done before [Ansible]({{< relref "20230319123221-ansible.md" >}}), eg. [SSH]({{< relref "20230320013331-ssh.md" >}}) setup etc.
-   Usually you run Terraform outside of the CI/CD process. Unless integration tests etc, then you might need TF in CI/CD.


## Practices/Best Practices {#practices-best-practices}

-   See [Evolving Your Infrastructure with Terraform - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgzgVm7Sqlk)


### Others {#others}

-   Consider building AMIs ([AWS]({{< relref "20231228230358-aws.md" >}})) that need to do minimal post-boot reconfiguration instead of booting a stock image and then bringing it into desired state from scratch.


### Stages and Modules {#stages-and-modules}

Think of the infra in layers of lifetime(you could also structure it the same way) (from reddit)

Eg.

-   Stage 1: VPC/networking/[DNS]({{< relref "20230213152146-dns.md" >}}) (will almost never change)
-   Stage 2: Stateful services (things that will rarely change)
-   Stage 3: Everything else.

Eg. **(Not super sure about following example, should Terraform be handling app deploy logic? (Don't think so))**
Split your configuration into modules/stages:

-   base (repositories, network, accounts)
-   app (docker deployment)

Then run those in different stages:

-   deploy base (creates repo needed to continue)
-   build image (docker build ... &amp;&amp; docker push ... now that we have a destination)
-   deploy app (deploy image from ECR you just uploaded)

We can then use TF datasources to grab resources from lower layers. It's easy to get your vpc id and subnet ids from layer 3
