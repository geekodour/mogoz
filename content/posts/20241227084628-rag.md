## What? {#what}

-   It's a work from MetaAI, "very specific way of training a generative model with a retriever together"
-   All the popular definition of RAG(using [Embeddings]({{< relref "20240916155700-embeddings.md" >}})) is just one of many ways to do RAG.


### Other ways to do RAG involve {#other-ways-to-do-rag-involve}

-   Multi-Hop retrieval
    -   Resolve some dependency before fetching the first info
-   Late interaction
    -   You prepare dense vectors for the `data` and `query`
    -   But it's hard to create a single vector for a long document
    -   Late interaction says, instead of a single vector, we represent a document as a matrix. So we represent the document as a set of its tokens and not as the document itself.

-  Step 0: Chunking

    This step is not graph rag specific but if we want to do graphRAG kind of search, we'd still want to do an initial semantic breakdown into more manageable chunks. This can be done based on based on whatever angle you want to do it, you can also do semantic chunking.

    Example semantic chunking prompt:

    ```python
    template_en = """
    {
        "instruction": "\nPlease understand the content of the text in the input field, recognize the structure and components of the text, and determine the segmentation points according to the semantic theme, dividing it into several non-overlapping sections. If the article has recognizable structural information such as chapters, please divide it according to the top-level structure.\nPlease return the results according to the schema definition, including summaries and starting points of the sections. The format must be a JSON string. Please follow the examples given in the example field.",
        "schema": {
            "Section Summary": "A brief summary of the section text",
            "Section Starting Point": "The starting point of the section in the original text, limited to about 20 characters. This segmentation point will be used to split the original text, so it must be found in the original text!"

-  Step 1: Graph Creation / Info Extractions

    -   There are 2 paths to KG generation today and both are problematic in their own ways
        -   1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) (model that is trained on an ontology that works with your data.)
        -   2. LLM
    -   atm, Most GraphRAG implementations rely on `LLM entity extraction` to build the graph. (`subject-predicate-object` triplets) is the entity we want to extract.

Clinically, many thyroid diseases, such as thyroid degeneration, inflammation, autoimmune conditions, and neoplasms, can present as nodules. Thyroid nodules can occur singly or in multiple forms; multiple nodules have a higher incidence than single nodules, but single nodules have a higher likelihood of being thyroid cancer. Patients typically have the option to register for consultation in general surgery, thyroid surgery, endocrinology, or head and neck surgery. Some patients can feel the nodules in the front of their neck. In most cases, thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, and thyroid function is normal. The probability of thyroid nodules progressing to other thyroid diseases is only about 1%. Some individuals may experience neck pain, a foreign body sensation in the throat, or a feeling of pressure. When spontaneous intracystic bleeding occurs in a thyroid nodule, the pain can be more intense. Treatment options generally include radioactive iodine therapy, Lugol's solution (a compound iodine oral solution), or antithyroid medications to suppress thyroid hormone secretion. Currently, commonly used antithyroid drugs are thiourea compounds, including propylthiouracil (PTU) and methylthiouracil (MTU) from the thiouracil class, and methimazole and carbimazole from the imidazole class.",

- <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span>  Step 1.5: Deciding the store

    -   In a vector store, "John manages Mary" and "Mary reports to John" might have similar embeddings, but the directional relationship isn't explicitly captured. So we might need a graph store (eg. neo4j)
    -   Graph databases excel at multi-hop queries and relationship traversal

-  Step 2: Index Building

    -   See "Font Loading" in [Open Source LLMs (Transformers)]({{< relref "20230719050449-open_source_llms.md" >}})
    -   Sometime fontloading/index building is enough
