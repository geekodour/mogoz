~~In BitTorrent, we already had some kind of content-addressed system where nodes seeded the files of others. Also, there was already a basic tit for tat mechanism for punishing badly behaving nodes~~

In a peer-to-peer network, every peer is connected to every other peer in the network. Semi-centralised peer-to-peer networks possess one or more peers with higher authority than most peers.
