## Intro {#intro}

-   Objective Categorical Abstract Machine language
-   ML: Meta Language


### Value and Expression {#value-and-expression}

### Definitions {#definitions}

-   These are like variable
-   Eg. `let x = 2` (let definition)
    -   This implicitly means, `let x = 2 in "rest of what i type"`


#### Comparison w let expression {#comparison-w-let-expression}

-   Eg. `let x = 2 in x` (let expressions, we can use this inside other expressions)
-   Here we're binding a value to `x`
-   Outside of this expression it'll not be bound to `x` whereas in case of `let` definition, it'll be bound to.


#### nested let expression w same variable name {#nested-let-expression-w-same-variable-name}

-   `let x = 5 in (let x = 6 in x)`
-   What this expression is evaluate to is the last `x`.
-   In ocaml, things are not mutable. So, `x` will not be redefined.
-   Order is left to right
    -   `let x = 5 in ...` : Alright, x is assigned 5 for that scope
    -   `let x = 6 in x` : A new x is assigned here, and evaluated to `x`
    -   `x` is returned. we get 6.(from the `innermost scope`). i.e `let x = 5 in 6`
    -   But we never used the older `x`. So the older `x` remain unused.
    -   In other words, ocaml will not let us substitute the older value of `x` in the nested expression because it'll violate Principle of Name Irrelevance
-   It's usually good not to mix the same variable name like this. You cannot get to the top level from the inner most level anyway for that `x`.


## Tooling basics {#tooling-basics}

-   opam : package manager
-   ocamlopt : native code compiler
-   ocamlc : bytecode compiler (less used)
