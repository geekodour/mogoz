## Structure {#structure}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230507105348-alternative_internet-1117137053.png" >}}

-   Calling [a network ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù only defines it by what it is not](https://scribe.rip/decentralized-web/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53)
    -   It is not dependent on a single set of servers run by one company.
    -   What it actually is can look like many different things.
-   Centralized and [Distributed]({{< relref "20221102130004-distributed_systems.md" >}}) are easy to understand, Decentralized is a mess but here's what I feel about it. I won't even mention blockchain. The lines are very blurry and things keep changing.
    -   [Federated]({{< relref "20230507135257-federated_systems.md" >}}) &sub; Decentralized
    -   [P2P]({{< relref "20221101184751-peer_to_peer.md" >}}) &sub; Decentralized
        -   Stuff using [NAT]({{< relref "20221101190313-nat.md" >}}) Traversal &sub; [P2P]({{< relref "20221101184751-peer_to_peer.md" >}})
        -   Stuff using local discovery  &sub; [P2P]({{< relref "20221101184751-peer_to_peer.md" >}})
        -   Stuff using overlay network to discover peers  &sub; [P2P]({{< relref "20221101184751-peer_to_peer.md" >}})
        -   Other stuff that is P2P but i can't think of &sub; [P2P]({{< relref "20221101184751-peer_to_peer.md" >}})
    -   { [Federated]({{< relref "20230507135257-federated_systems.md" >}}), [P2P]({{< relref "20221101184751-peer_to_peer.md" >}}) } &sub; Decentralized
-   In the wild software use mix of centralized, distributed and decentralized so it's hard to truly fit an application into these structure.
-   The applications that can be made out of these structure is simply your imagination, filesharing, social networks, chat systems, hosting, identity systems and everything else.


## Decentralized {#decentralized}

-   These systems usually have common things to deal with
    -   Identity
    -   Key management
    -   Moderation
    -   Monetization
-   Decentralization: "For the builders, it‚Äôs a core feature. But for almost all users, it‚Äôs certainly a detail."


### P2P {#p2p}

-   No distinction between clients and servers.
-   Every user‚Äôs device can act as both, making them functionally equivalent as peers.
-   Some nodes may have special roles, like public bootstrap nodes that help new users get connected to the network etc.
-   See [peer-to-peer]({{< relref "20221101184751-peer_to_peer.md" >}})


### Federated {#federated}

-   Users are still interacting with a server
-   But anyone can run a server that interoperates with others servers in the network, giving users more providers to choose from.
-   This gives users more choices for applications, policies, and community cultures.
-   See [Federated systems]({{< relref "20230507135257-federated_systems.md" >}})


### Hybrid {#hybrid}

-   Like I said line is heckin blurry.
-   This is what [nostr]({{< relref "20230507142440-nostr.md" >}})(a growing decentralized social network), mentions in its readme. It's funny.
-   Nostr is not federated(A relay doesn't talk to another relay, only directly to users), doesn't work on p2p principles, still decentralized.

    > It doesn't rely on any trusted central server, hence it is resilient; it is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, so it is tamperproof; it does not rely on P2P techniques, and therefore it works.


## Things on the internet that make the internet {#things-on-the-internet-that-make-the-internet}

![](/ox-hugo/20230507105348-alternative_internet-585557407.png)
![](/ox-hugo/20230507105348-alternative_internet-468539994.png)

-   See this: [alternative-internet-dump](https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet)
-   See: [Ecosystem Overview](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/README.md)
-   This is obviously not exhaustive.
-   These things are complimentary to other things on the internet. Like a centralized/distributed/decentralized/human/social/ai system could make use of them or not.


### Bridges and Gateways {#bridges-and-gateways}

Even when things are not federated, by the nature what these things are we can always creates certain gridges and gateways to things.

-   [Bird.makeup: a Twitter to ActivityPub bridge | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34748669)
-   <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed>
-   <https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge>
-   <https://github.com/Cameri/smtp-nostr-gateway>


### Fidverse {#fidverse}

-   Fediverse is about software implementations and services being able to talk to each other.
-   This is not a replacement of the idea of indieweb, these can compliment each other.
-   At the moment, anything that supports activitypub is in the fidverse. If you have a mastodon account you're in fidverse.
-   But the specs for indieweb and activitypub come from the same group of ppl.


### Linkback {#linkback}

-   A linkback is a method for Web authors to obtain notifications when other authors link to one of their documents.
-   Different from `backlink`
    -   Backlink: What gets created when a person refers to a page
    -   Linkback: What the publisher of the page being referred to receives.


#### Refback {#refback}

-   Usage of the HTTP referrer header to discover incoming links.


#### Webmentions {#webmentions}

-   X and Y both are webpages/URLs, webmention allows
    -   Y to send notification to X, when Y links to X
    -   X to receive notification from Y, when Y links to X
-   It's was built by the indieweb ppl, later became w3c recom. cool stuff.

#### Others {#others}

[Tracebacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback) and [Pingbacks](http://hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0) are relics of the past at this point but mentioning for completeness.


### Indieweb {#indieweb}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230507105348-alternative_internet-786463851.png" >}}

-   Read this: [Notes on indieweb vs fidverse](http://dustycloud.org/blog/on-standards-divisions-collaboration/) (some politics)
-   IndieWeb is about owning your online presence via your own domain name.


#### Popular names {#popular-names}

-   Webmentions: better pingbacks (see above)
-   ActivityPub: (See [Federated systems]({{< relref "20230507135257-federated_systems.md" >}})), this sort of came out of the same community
-   Micropub: While ActivityPub is protocol describing a decentralized social network, [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) is a way for "you" to post content to "your" own website from 3rd party platforms or your own systems that you built.
