This is about two or more sessions try to access the same data at the same time. So we put locks in the transactions. So locks are things that we put in transactions.

## FAQ {#faq}


### Exclusive vs Shared Locks? {#exclusive-vs-shared-locks}

-   This is general terms, with something like [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}), we need to be more specific about which lock exactly are we talking about
-   Usually `Exclusive` will mean you lock both R&amp;W
    -   NOTE: [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) does have an actual table lock named "EXCLUSIVE" but it's refering to that specific lock and not to this generalized definition of `Exclusive` lock. Same goes for `SHARE`.
-   Usually `Shared` would mean only W is locked, read can be done by other transactions etc


### Preventing Conflicts {#preventing-conflicts}

-   Locks alone are not sufficient to prevent conflicts
-   A concurrency control strategy must define how locks are being acquired and released
-   As this also has an impact on transaction interleaving. (See [Non-realtime interleaved execution model]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md#non-realtime-interleaved-execution-model" >}}))


## Types of [Concurrency]({{< relref "20221126204257-concurrency.md" >}}) control {#types-of-concurrency--20221126204257-concurrency-dot-md--control}

Different DBs have differnt names and implementations, this is just generalization.

#### Read lock {#read-lock}

-   Prevents a resource from being written while allowing other concurrent reads.


#### Write lock {#write-lock}

Blocks both Readers and Writers concurring for the same lock


### Pessimistic locking (Avoid Conflicts) {#pessimistic-locking--avoid-conflicts}

> Sidenote: RWMutex and [Two Phase Locking (2PL)]({{< relref "20231116010456-two_phase_locking_2pl.md" >}}) are similar, one is more used application development and the latter one more in database [transaction safety]({{< relref "20231113121413-concurrency_consistency_models.md" >}}) etc.

-   `RWMutex`, [Two Phase Locking (2PL)]({{< relref "20231116010456-two_phase_locking_2pl.md" >}}) etc.
-   Atomics don't scale either
-   Such shared locking help, but they [do not scale](https://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/reader-writer-problem). In order to scale RWMutex,
    -   Time spent by readers while holding the mutex should be significant
    -   Otherwise, overhead of synchronizing between multiple readers becomes dominant, and the system won't scale well. Because the synchronization itself is a write operation on the mutex's internal data.
    -   See [Amdahl's law - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law), [How to Quantify Scalability](http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html)


### Optimistic locking mechanism (Allow conflicts, better scalability, Time based) {#optimistic-locking-mechanism--allow-conflicts-better-scalability-time-based}

-   Allow conflicts to occur, but you need to detect them. Reader starts reading an object w/o any synchronization (optimistically hoping for success), and when it finishes it verifies that the object was not changed under its feet.


#### Logical clocks {#logical-clocks}

-   See [Clocks]({{< relref "20231119003900-clocks.md" >}})


#### State distribution {#state-distribution}

-   [State distribution](https://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/reader-writer-problem/state-distribution)
-   Also see [Data Replication]({{< relref "20231021151742-data_replication.md" >}})


#### MVCC {#mvcc}

-   See [MVCC]({{< relref "20231116004530-mvcc.md" >}})
-   NOTE: There are some variants of MVCC which use Pessimistic locking. (Eg. MV2PL)


### Other locks {#other-locks}


#### Predicate locks {#predicate-locks}


#### Range locks {#range-locks}


## Lock levels {#lock-levels}

-   Serialized Database Access
    -   Making the database run queries one by one
    -   Terrible concurrency
    -   Highest level of consistency
-   Table Lock
    -   Lock the table for your transaction with slightly better concurrency, but concurrent table writes are still slowed.
-   Row Lock
    -   Locks the row you are working on even better than table locks, but if multiple transactions need this row, they will need to wait.
    -   Row-level read and write locks are recorded directly in the locked rows and can be inspected using the pgrowlocks extension.
-   Range locks
    -   Between the last two levels of locks(Table and Row); they lock the range of values captured by the transaction and don't allow inserts or updates within the range captured by the transaction.


## Postgres Lock Modes {#postgres-lock-modes}


### What are lock modes? {#what-are-lock-modes}

> Specific to pg
>
> When [MVCC]({{< relref "20231116004530-mvcc.md" >}}) does not suffice, application devs can use these lock modes. They're defined by which other lock modes they `conflict` with, which in-turn are used by different `commands`. Difference between one lock mode and another is: the set of lock modes with which each conflicts/compatible with.

-   Lock modes are either `Table Level` or `Row Level`
-   Most PostgreSQL commands automatically acquire locks of appropriate modes to carry out things. Otherwise dev can use `LOCK` (table only).
    -   `TRUNCATE` obtains an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock to carry out its actions.
    -   `SELECT` acquires `ACCESS SHARE` lock mode
    -   `UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT` acquire `ROW EXCLUSIVE` lock mode
    -   `CREATE INDEX` acquires `SHARE` lock


#### Lock vs Lock Mode in Postgres {#lock-vs-lock-mode-in-postgres}

If we say "Transaction A holds an `EXCLUSIVE` lock on Table T", we mean:

-   There is an actual lock (mechanism) on Table T
-   This lock is operating in `EXCLUSIVE mode` (behavior)


### Postgres Lock modes {#postgres-lock-modes}


#### How to take locks? {#how-to-take-locks}

devs can acquire the advisory locks and as-well as the normal pg specific locks using the `LOCK` command. But the pg specific locks can be otherwise used implicitly via the "lock modes". PG already takes implicit locks for its operations, we can tap into them by using the lock modes

<!--list-separator-->

-  Table level

    -   `LOCK` statement can be used to acquire ONLY `tabel-level` lock mode on-demand (this is usually not needed)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Row level

    -   `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` is the primary way to "explicitly" acquire a `row-level` lock. The other transaction will just wait till tx gets over.
        -   `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` similar to `FOR UPDATE`, but doesn't wait, instead raises an error
        -   `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` skips any rows that are already locked by other transactions.
    -   Pure `SELECT` statements do not block reads, but another concurrent `SELECT... FOR UPDATE` operation will block until the first `SELECT... FOR UPDATE` transaction completes.
    -   `NOWAIT` only works for `SELECT` statement, if we want `NOWAIT` behavior on `UPDATE` (which by default will just wait) then we'll have to run a SELECT before UPDATE.
        ```sql
        WITH locked_workflow AS (
            SELECT
                *
            FROM
                workflow_run
            WHERE
                workflow_run.id = $1
            FOR UPDATE
                NOWAIT
        )
        UPDATE
            workflow_run
        SET
            status = $2
        WHERE
            workflow_run.id = $1
            AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM locked_workflow); -- this is just so that CTE is evaluated
        ```


#### Catalog {#catalog}

<https://leontrolski.github.io/pglockpy.html>

<!--list-separator-->

-  Table Lock modes (8)

    > NOTE: Some locks have "row" in the name but they still mean table level locks

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231114211916-database_locks-1723702645.png" >}}

    -   Once acquired, a lock is normally held until the end of the transaction.
    -   If a lock is acquired after establishing a savepoint, the lock is released immediately if the savepoint is rolled back to.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Row Locks modes (4)

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231114211916-database_locks-1436036718.png" >}}

    -   These too like table level locks are used automatically by postgres when required by different commands
    -   The same transaction can hold conflicting locks
        -   on the same row
        -   on the same row, even in different subtransactions
    -   2 different transactions can never hold conflicting locks on the same row.
    -   Release is similar to table lock release


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Advisory locks {#advisory-locks}

> Advisory locks are application-defined locks that are not tied to a particular database object (like a table or row). Instead, they are associated with arbitrary integers defined by the application. They allow you to implement locking schemes at the application level that are managed by the database.

-   Locks that applications can use
-   Eg. emulate pessimistic locking strategies typical of so-called “flat file” data management systems.
-   While a flag stored in a table could be used for the same purpose, advisory locks are faster, avoid table bloat
-   Automatically cleaned up by the server at the end of the session
-   Acquire
    -   Session level
        -   Held until explicitly released or the session ends
        -   TODO Unlike standard lock requests, session-level advisory lock requests do not honor transaction semantics: a lock acquired during a transaction that is later rolled back will still be held following the rollback, and likewise an unlock is effective even if the calling transaction fails later. A lock can be acquired multiple times by its owning process; for each completed lock request there must be a corresponding unlock request before the lock is actually released.
    -   Transaction level
