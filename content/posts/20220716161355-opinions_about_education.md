some found on the internet, some of them are my own, all of them are debatable


## Random ones {#random-ones}

Learning
: -   So many students are in schools but they are failing to learn this is the learning crisis, not the education crisis.
    -   Technology is not just an add-on, but central to learning. Bring school to children if we can't bring children to school.
    -   It happens between teachers and students, the policymakers are not there in the education circle.
    -   The deepest learning happens when you struggle with truly hard problems.
    -   Active learning solves the two sigma problem.
    -   [learning]({{< relref "20220625160938-learning.md" >}}) something in the expense of play is bad. Apprenticeship is good.
    -   Technically, for the normal 6-7 year old kid to start reading it takes about 100 hours that is 2 hours per day for 50 days. Yet some kids don't know how to read being 5 years at school. Who is to blame?

Course Admission
: -   Sometimes a student might be eligible for a course even if the eligibility gatekeeping does not allow the student to apply.
    -   there’s no easy way to connect to them and discuss personal problems related to the admission.
    -   not just education 1-1, the situation a student is in before the education begins should also be 1-1 rather than just the eligibility criteria decide it. i.e have an custom eligibility way or something.

Teachers
: -   Leadership in education, it should not be command and control. It should be climate control, creating a climate of possibilities for students and teachers to learn. They can either play football in the rain, else test the new umbrella that they invented.
    -   No education system is better than their teachers. i.e Teachers are a bottleneck.
    -   make teaching cool and profitable, so that more and more ppl want to teach. Current situation is pretty opaque and teachers do be facing a lot of problem from what I understand.
    -   Finland addresses the strongest principles in the toughest schools. The most talented teachers into the most challenging classrooms.
    -   How to improve the teacher who are struggling
    -   How teacher pay structured
    -   Our teachers need to have weekly study groups and collaborate with each other. We need a system that makes our average teachers the best.
    -   Help teachers to grow in their careers
    -   Enable teachers to change ways of how they teach.
    -   Just like students some teachers are far more efficient than others.

Smart kids
: -   Convincing kids that they are smart or stupid is harmful. this leads to strong social disparities when they grow up.

Hate
: -   Role of the education system not only to teach things well but also to help maintain sanity in the society by teaching not to spread hate aswell.

Jobs
: -   People think giving job opportunities is enough, think giving money is enough. It’s not.
    -   I believe every student is capable of success.
    -   People should be able to start a new career, new study at [age of 30](https://www.tatasecondcareer.com/). Nothing [to be ashamed](https://www.jobsforher.com/) of. This has to change culturally.
    -   They want a job(a better one) but they won’t do shit to improve their skills. Basically they want a better job with fuckall skills. They will keep giving exams here, exams there hoping to get a job. Logic is fucked.

Education System
: -   a system that should pass human knowledge to new humans so that they can consume it and make use of it to create even more new human knowledge taking the human race forward.
    -   Talking about the education system as a system points to something that's approaching uniformity. Because, school A is very different from school B. So maybe it's poor naming choice.
    -   The current advancements are phenomenal but the issue is the people on top are less and suffering is much in the other end of the spectrum. We need to improve the system for the other end.
    -   The current format of the ed system is not super helpful in doing the passing of knowledge, not a lot of research is done on the how to better do the passing
    -   Technology is a non-linear tool, you can search for anything, not just education. Our education system is very linear. If you put a non-linear tool into a linear system the power of technology will be limited. This means we need to make our education system non-linear or something.

School
: -   Schools fail at teaching people how to learn.
    -   Motivation has to be something more concrete than "good grades"
    -   Schools tend to compress learning about a given subject into a limited time frame, then only revisit it in final exams. This is the wrong approach. contradicts with the idea of doing great work happens under pressure, maybe the wrong kind of pressure here.
    -   Third, learning occurs far better from trying to recall and apply information than from having it passively presented to you. eg. More tests = better? debatable. The standardized test has a place but they should not be the dominant culture of our education system.
    -   I was hating **history** because it was presented to me as a get this in your head problem.
    -   Dividing kids in age-based groups is very poor.  Skill-based is better. What about Teacher-based?
    -   A test should be done not so then they can game the exams, but so that they can measure themselves if they are ready for the next not as a benchmark with others. The ability and accessibility for a student to know if he's doing right or wrong are very important.

Meta
: -   What i am doing is not for kids really, it's about a better wellbeing and happiness for people in everyday life. Making people realize that life can be good and not miserable and they can do something about it. Make the information available and accessible. Provide them a safeground and time to play around and grow. Let them know of ways that exists and ways how they can navigate the world. Help people understand the world and their place in the world better so that they can help take humanity forward and aswell live a happy life while they are here.
    -   Our world is very old and very new, you can't be the only person having the problem you're having. Look at other successful people who faced similar problems like you and see how and what works out, what you need to come up with yourself. It's all about figuring our pace and place and then enjoying the rest of it and having the ability to adapt to the dimension of time and change
    -   Productivity metric at different places can be contextual, in the poor slum, it'll make more sense for a kid to learn a skill that can he/she/they can generate some income than learning to read and write so we can reorder the priority accordingly. They should know the basic ideas to sustain themselves, like hygiene which is not taught to them in how they are bought up.
    -   Poor people think quality education means going to private schools which is not quite right.
    -   Education might be available but not within reach. We have the solution for both, we just need the user to realize that there's the problem and apply the solution.
    -   Socioeconomic status has an effect size of 0.57, meaning that a student growing up in poverty may be expected to perform roughly a year and a half behind an otherwise similar student growing up more wealthy.
    -   The lawmakers make stupid laws about education because they do not have good taste about education
    -   Students are taught sex ed not to fuckup later. they are not taught career ed which leads to fucked up careers.
    -   The overall problem with education is that many people don't realize that something better is possible, we should not stop innovation in our education business. The stagnation of the education system is not very nice to have. If we can make every, principal, teacher, school, child, parent, realize that improvement is possible, we will lay our foundation for better lives.
    -   The education bubble is about security and insurance against the future. Compare this with the gun case. ppl buying guns to stay safe. Maybe they do need them. But maybe they should also examine some of the reasons life is so dangerous and try to solve those too.

College
: -   Measuring how much time students spend in schools(attendance) or what degree they have is not always the best way to see what they can actually do. Counting how many bodies are in the classroom versus how many are actually learning. Very debatable though.
    -   Not every kid needs to go to college. Are you bad at that book learning stuff? That's fine - push more kids into trade schools.
    -   The business model of the education system does not care how many of the students fail. A school is producing failed students every year and the school decides to do the same every single year.

Books
: -   It's totally okay to throw away obsolete books if book is not like super rare.


## Weird ones {#weird-ones}

Thinking
: -   Culture of school is very important.
    -   The primary part of making progress this problem finding, forget solutions maybe we are in the wrong context
    -   Thinking is not logical thinking is choosing the environment before you start rationalizing
    -   About creativity
        -   Creativity: having original ideas that have value.
        -   Divergent thinking: it is the capacity for creativity, to think laterally not linearly.

Funding and money
: -   Domestic financing has to be the backbone of education.
    -   People need to be attracted to education, there is a payoff but you have to wait a long time that will be too long if you are poor.
    -   Coming up with a market solution to a certain problem of education is better than relying on charity

Equity
: -   People from different social backgrounds have equal chances. At least we should aim for that.
    -   Combining excellence with equity, you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence.
    -   Education tech should be given to remote schools first.

Effect
: -   Education should be:
        -   Paid by taxation
        -   Compulsory to everyone
        -   Free at point of delivery
        -   Should decrease unemployment and increases school performance

MOOCS
: -   People are caught up in fantasy scenarios about what MOOCs can do, and most of it is overwrought. The real difficulty is in reaching the large number of students who are not self-starters and aware of the importance of and methods for self-education. Until MOOCs can figure out how to reach this (very tough) audience, they will have limited effect (and in fact will lead to a Matthew Effect). - Shriram Krishnamurthi


## From the internet {#from-the-internet}

quotes
: -   Until we're educating every kid in a fantastic way, until every inner city is cleaned up, there is no shortage of things to do.
    -   If science is to progress, what we need is the ability to experiment
    -   People should only teach what they've learned organically, through experience and curiosity, or get another job.
    -   “If by intellectual you mean somebody who works only with his head and not with his hands, then the bank clerk is an intellectual and Michelangelo is not. And today, with a computer, everybody is an intellectual. So I don’t think it has anything to do with someone’s profession or with someone’s social class. According to me, an intellectual is anyone who is creatively producing new knowledge. A peasant who understands that a new kind of graft can produce a new species of apples has at that moment produced an intellectual activity. Whereas the professor of philosophy who all his life repeats the same lecture on Heidegger doesn’t amount to an intellectual. Critical creativity—criticizing what we are doing or inventing better ways of doing it—is the only mark of the intellectual function.” — Umberto Eco, The Art of Fiction No. 197: An Interview by Lila Azam Zanganeh

situation
: -   Poverty wage workers cannot budget their way to economic stability. Offering financial literacy workshops when what they need is a living wage is insulting and immoral
