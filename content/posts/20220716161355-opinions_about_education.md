some found on the internet, some of them are my own, all of them are debatable


## Random ones {#random-ones}

-   rot-learning is bad of unimportant stuff, info fads fast. Doing this in the expense of play and physical activity is worse. Apprenticeship is good.
-   I could not join ashoka because i did not qualify college. but i probably qualify to be there. moreover, there’s no easy way to connect to them and discuss my specific problems. not just education 1-1, the situatuon a student is in before the education begins should also be 1-1.
-   One of my goals is to make teachning cool, so that more and more ppl want to teach. and it's not the those who do tteach etc quote thing.
-   Convincing kids that they are smart or stupid is harmful. this is related to very strong social disparities.
-   Role of the education system not only to teach things well but also to help improve society by teaching not to spread hate aswell.
-   People should be able to start a new career, new study at age of 30. Nothing to be ashamed of. This has to change culturally: [<https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/p9sosq/is_30_too_late_an_age_to_start_a_career_in_india/>](<https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/p9sosq/is_30_too_late_an_age_to_start_a_career_in_india/>)
-   Students at normal schools never get to learn good writing, or public speaking, or to plan, schedule and execute on their own projects, or to navigate the bureaucracy, financial planning, media preparedness,  propaganda analysis, job hunting, entrepreneurship, art, etc.
-   Schools fail at teaching people how to learn.
    -   Motivation has to be something more concrete than "good grades"
    -   Schools tend to compress learning about a given subject into a limited time frame, then only revisit it in final exams. This is the wrong approach. contradicts with the idea of doing great work happens under pressure, maybe the wrong kind of pressure here.
    -   Third, learning occurs far better from trying to recall and apply information than from having it passively presented to you. eg. More tests = better ? debatable. The standardized test has a place but they should not be the dominant culture of our education system.
-   I was hating ******history****** because it was presented to me as a ******get this in your head****** problem.
-   Dividing kids in age-based groups is very poor.  Skill-based is better. Teacher-based is sub-optimal.
-   The lawmakers make stupid laws about education because they do not have good taste about education
-   A test should be done not so then they can game the exams, but so that they can measure themselves if they are ready for the next not as a benchmark with others. The ability and accessibility for a student to know if he's doing right or wrong are very important.
-   Vertical curriculum
-   The gamut: private preschool, public elementary school, charter middle school, inner-city public middle-school, elite private boarding school, magnet public high-school. ******In India, this is different.******
-   Talking about the education system as a system points to something that's approaching uniformity. Because, school A is very different from school B.
-   Today's education system is the best that's ever been because most people today know how to read. Solving this does not fix HigherEd. It fails to show students what they are capable of and what are their options.
-   Not every kid needs to go to college. Are you bad at that book learning stuff? That's fine - push more kids into trade schools.
-   Education is important, but the system we have today sucks. At the same time, we must consider if education is the priority for a particular individual. (Mental health)
-   The deepest learning happens when you struggle with truly hard problems.
-   The education bubble is about security and insurance against the future.
-   He compares it to a world in which everyone was buying guns to stay safe. Maybe they do need them. But maybe they should also examine some of the reasons life is so dangerous and try to solve those too.
-   Students are taught sex ed not to fuckup later. they are not taught career ed which leads to fucked up careers.
-   Socioeconomic status has an effect size of 0.57, meaning that a student growing up in poverty may be expected to perform roughly a year and a half behind an otherwise similar student growing up more wealthy.
-   Active learning solves the two sigma problem.
-   The business model of the education system does not care how many of the students fail. A school is producing failed students every year and the school decides to do the same every single year.
-   Poor people think quality education means going to private schools which is not quite right.
-   Technically, for the normal 6-7 year old kid to start reading it takes about 100 hours that is 2 hours per day for 50 days. Yet some kids don't know how to read being 5 years at school.
-   Technology is a non-linear tool, you can search for anything, not just education. Our education system is very linear. If you put a non-linear tool into a linear system the power of technology will be limited. This means we need to make our education system non-linear or something.
-   Productivity metric at different places can be contextual, in the poor slum, it'll make more sense for a kid to learn a skill that can he/she/they can generate some income than learning to read and write so we can reorder the priority accordingly. They should know the basic ideas to sustain themselves, like hygiene which is not taught to them in how they are bought up.
-   The overall problem with education is that many people don't realize that something better is possible, we should not stop innovation in our education business. The stagnation of the education system is not very nice to have. If we can make every, principal, teacher, school, child, parent, realize that improvement is possible, we will lay our foundation for better lives.
-   Finland addresses the strongest principles in the toughest schools. The most talented teachers into the most challenging classrooms.
-   Education might be available but not within reach. We have the solution for both, we just need the user to realize that there's the problem and apply the solution.
-   I believe every student is capable of success.
-   No education system is better than their teachers. i.e Teachers are a bottleneck.


## Weird ones {#weird-ones}

-   Thinking is not logical thinking is choosing the environment before you start rationalizing
-   Why are there so many different variety of educational content for the same thing, is it good or bad? but it's true that everyone understands differently and the requirement of level of understanding is different. (eg. Shashank wouldn't want to talk to Brian, even if I am dying to have a chat with him)
-   Education systtem: a system that should pass human knowledge to new humans so that can consume it and make use of it to create even new human knowledge and making the human race better and smarter. (Maybe there can be a differrent purpose of the ed system?) The current format of the ed system is not very helpful in doing the **passing** , not a lot of research is done on the how to better do the **passing** (eg. different mediums, how it should adapt to places, teachers etc. some kind of runbook can be helpful)
-   The primary part of making progress this problem finding, forget solutions maybe we are in the wrong context
-   Education should be:
    -   Paid by taxation
    -   Compulsory to everyone
    -   Free at point of delivery
    -   Should decrease unemployment and increases school performance
-   About creativity
    -   Creativity: having original ideas that have value.
    -   Divergent thinking: it is the capacity for creativity, to think laterally not linearly.
-   People need to be attracted to education, motivation: extrinsic, there is a payoff but you have to wait a long time that will be too long if you are poor.
-   About Teachers:
    -   How to improve the teacher who are struggling
    -   How teacher pay structured
    -   Our teachers need to have weekly study groups and collaborate with each other. We need a system that makes our average teachers the best.
    -   Help teachers to grow in their careers
    -   Enable teachers to change ways of how they teach.
    -   Just like students some teachers are far more efficient than others.
-   Equity in education
    -   People from different social backgrounds have equal chances. At least we should aim for that.
    -   Combining excellence with equity, you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence.
    -   Education tech should be given to remote schools first.
-   It happens between teachers and students, the policymakers are not there in the education circle.
-   Culture of school is very important.
-   Leadership in education, it should not be command and control. It should be climate control, creating a climate of possibilities for students and teachers to learn. They can either play football in the rain, else test the new umbrella that they invented.
-   Measuring how much time students spend in schools or what degree they have is not always the best way to see what they can actually do. (Attendance!) Counting how many bodies are in the classroom versus how many are actually learning.
-   Technology is not just an add-on, but central to learning. Bring school to children if we can't bring children to school.
-   Domestic financing has to be the backbone of education.
-   So many students are in schools but they are failing to learn this is the learning crisis, not the education crisis.
-   People are caught up in fantasy scenarios about what MOOCs can do, and most of it is overwrought. The real difficulty is in reaching the large number of students who are not self-starters and aware of the importance of and methods for self-education. Until MOOCs can figure out how to reach this (very tough) audience, they will have limited effect (and in fact will lead to a Matthew Effect). - Shriram Krishnamurthi
-   I’ve not noticed this with many, but i noticed this with my sister. They want a job(a better one) but they won’t do shit to improve their skill. Basically they want a better job with fuckall skills. They will keep giving exams here, exams there hoping to get a job. This is understandable with families which are poor, our family is quite well to do.
-   People think giving job opportunities is enough, think giving money is enough. It’s not.
-   What i am doing is not for kids really, it's about a better wellbeing and happiness for people in everyday life. Making people realize that life can be good and not miserable and they can do something about it. Make the information available and accessible. Provide them a safeground and time to play around and grow. Let them know of ways that exists and ways how they can navigate the world. Help people understand the world and their place in the world better so that they can help take humanity forward and aswell live a happy life while they are here.
-   Our world is very old and very new, you can't be the only person having the problem you're having. Look at other successful people who faced similar problems like you and see how and what works out, what you need to come up with yourself. It's all about figuring our pace and place and then enjoying the rest of it and having the ability to adapt to the dimension of time and change


## From the internet {#from-the-internet}

-   Until we're educating every kid in a fantastic way, until every inner city is cleaned up, there is no shortage of things to do.
-   If science is to progress, what we need is the ability to experiment
-   Poverty wage workers cannot budget their way to economic stability. Offering financial literacy workshops when what they need is a living wage is insulting and immoral
-   People should only teach what they've learned organically, through experience and curiosity, or get another job.
-   “If by intellectual you mean somebody who works only with his head and not with his hands, then the bank clerk is an intellectual and Michelangelo is not. And today, with a computer, everybody is an intellectual. So I don’t think it has anything to do with someone’s profession or with someone’s social class. According to me, an intellectual is anyone who is creatively producing new knowledge. A peasant who understands that a new kind of graft can produce a new species of apples has at that moment produced an intellectual activity. Whereas the professor of philosophy who all his life repeats the same lecture on Heidegger doesn’t amount to an intellectual. Critical creativity—criticizing what we are doing or inventing better ways of doing it—is the only mark of the intellectual function.” — Umberto Eco, The Art of Fiction No. 197: An Interview by Lila Azam Zanganeh
