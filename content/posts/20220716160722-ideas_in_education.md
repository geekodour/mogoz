## For Profit Ideas {#for-profit-ideas}

-   Build a framework(X) that allows private organizations to sell licenses to their study material, teaching methods to diff. org(including govt. organizations) so they can earn some profit off of it. Think about this relating to UPI, ****banks→schools, UPI→X, private and govt schools****. Different merchants exchanging goods at their own will based on some regulatory body, i.e guidelines to follow to prepare learning content. This will allow alternative education to be encouraged in India.
-   Example for the previous point; if statistics teacher needs some kind of backup or help on the syllabus, they can hire other teachers who can help them teach the subject better way collaboratively. (eg. How Google hires contractual companies). The teachers should know who to reach out when they are not able to solve a problem, the problem here is some students not grasping the concepts.
-   I am not sure of the current state of education organizations but regulations should allow people to start schools, small schools, independent schools, they can hire teachers from these organizations then.
-   ****Opinion****: Coming up with a market solution to a certain problem of education is better than relying on charity
-   How to become different stakeholders in education, eg. how to become a teacher, how to become a policymaker, etc.


## Communities {#communities}

-   Donate your laptop, we'll install Linux on it and share it with students who need it.
-   Make education a platform, eg. people and students prepare excellent study materials that schools can buy and that can be used to teach students. Govt. should have a spec for such courses, people can develop such courses and schools can buy them.
-   Make schools feel more like a museum, have some fixed for giving school tours, people can come to visit a school if they have an appointment and learn more about how education happens here. Explore the problems that the school is facing and use help if the visitor is able to give any help. "Go visit a school/NGO should" be an action.
-   If you're visiting a new city for a few days, you search for places to teach your skill/if anyone asked about learning that skill. then you can arrange an offline class with them. similar to the NGO tour thingy.
-   writing rooms styled by historical epoch Hemingway room: Havana-themed cafe, stifling pre-AC humidity, tendrils of smoke rising from ashtray Shakespeare room: formal English attire, classical music playing in the background, actors rehearsing lines
-   A list of things that people can act upon, this can be combined with the testgrid. Eg. People can realize that we're missing reading rooms in Guwahati which help in developing reading habits which help in making better citizens. So someone who is interested can start a reading room, otherwise people don't even realize that there is this problem unless they themselves feel it even if they have the capability to act on it.
-   Math camps!
