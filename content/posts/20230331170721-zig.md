## Notes {#notes}

-   No runtime
-   No macros
-   On top of being a programming language, Zig is a full-fledged C/C++ cross compiler that leverages LLVM
-   Zig bundles standard libraries for all major platforms (GNU libc, musl libc, ...), an advanced artifact caching system, and it has a flag-compatible interface for both clang and gcc.
