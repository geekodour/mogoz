## FAQ {#faq}


### Backup and data recovery {#backup-and-data-recovery}

More info [Could Age Replace OpenPGP? {The Call of the Open Sidewalk}](https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:agevspgp)


#### Bad data {#bad-data}

-   Different encryption tools like GPG and `age` may deal with this differently.
-   So good to check the integrity of the input file before attempting to do anything with it.
-   Example `age` : No data or partial data is better than bad data
    ```shell
    $ age -d -i key.txt -o totc_out.txt totc.txt.age
    Error: chacha20poly1305: message authentication failed
    [ Did age not do what you expected? Could an error be more useful? Tell us: https://filippo.io/age/report ]
    $ ls -l totc_out.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 operator  operator  0 Dec 25 12:53 totc_out.txt # zero length output!!
    ```
-   Example `gpg` : Partial bad data is better than no data
    ```shell
    $ gpg2 -d totc.txt.pgp >totc_out.txt
    gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID B456C3BB5A48A0EA, created 2020-06-01
          "BACKUP <backup@store>"
          gpg: WARNING: encrypted message has been manipulated!
    $ ls -l totc_out.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 operator  operator  807615 Dec 25 15:26 totc_out.txt
    ```


### Database data encryption {#database-data-encryption}

-   See [Database]({{< relref "20221102123145-database.md" >}})
-   The laziest solution to the “encrypted database” use-case is to just use deterministic encryption, such as AES-ECB or with a static IV/nonce. (NOT GOOD)
-   DO: Encrypt securely (i.e. AEAD with random nonces).


## Cipher {#cipher}

### Block Cipher {#block-cipher}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230417101756-cryptography-2132625002.png" >}}

-   A secure "random-looking id generator"
-   Block ciphers with less than 128 bits of output are widely considered insecure: this corresponds to about 22 base64 characters.
-   A block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts blocks of a fixed length. The encryption function E transforms plaintext blocks P into ciphertext blocks C by using a secret key k.


### Stream Cipher {#stream-cipher}

-   A stream cipher is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that encrypts a stream of bits.
-   Ideally, that stream could be as long as weʼd like; real-world stream ciphers have limits, but sufficient for practical use


### Stream vs Block {#stream-vs-block}

-   Several block ciphers have modes of operation that allow them to function in a streaming-like manner.
    -   Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and Counter (CTR) etc.
-   With stream ciphers, we know that certain metadata is at certain indices in the stream.
    -   `What do I know about the plaintext` and `what can I LEARN about the plaintext from observing the ciphertext` are two different things.
    -   This is a "priori knowledge". The fact that you used a stream cipher didn't change anything, but it also didn't leak anything.
    -   Stream cipher may seem less secure compared to a block cipher (In a block bits are sort of jumbled around &amp; don't have fixed position)
    -   But if we ensure `authenticity`, `integrity` (HMAC), we're good. With stream cipher the attacker can know what could be where based on the protocol but does not know nothing about the actual data. So we all good.
