## Backup and data recovery {#backup-and-data-recovery}

More info [Could Age Replace OpenPGP? {The Call of the Open Sidewalk}](https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:agevspgp)


### Bad data {#bad-data}

-   Different encryption tools like GPG and `age` may deal with this differently.
-   So good to check the integrity of the input file before attempting to do anything with it.
-   Example `age` : No data or partial data is better than bad data
    ```shell
    $ age -d -i key.txt -o totc_out.txt totc.txt.age
    Error: chacha20poly1305: message authentication failed
    [ Did age not do what you expected? Could an error be more useful? Tell us: https://filippo.io/age/report ]
    $ ls -l totc_out.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 operator  operator  0 Dec 25 12:53 totc_out.txt # zero length output!!
    ```
-   Example `gpg` : Partial bad data is better than no data
    ```shell
    $ gpg2 -d totc.txt.pgp >totc_out.txt
    gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID B456C3BB5A48A0EA, created 2020-06-01
          "BACKUP <backup@store>"
          gpg: WARNING: encrypted message has been manipulated!
    $ ls -l totc_out.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 operator  operator  807615 Dec 25 15:26 totc_out.txt
    ```
