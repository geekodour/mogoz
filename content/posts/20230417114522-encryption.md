### Block Cipher {#block-cipher}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230417101756-cryptography-2132625002.png" >}}

-   `fixed-size key x fixed-size message = ecncryted message of block size`
    -   The different "modes" help operate block cipher
-   A secure "random-looking id generator"
-   Block ciphers with less than 128 bits of output are widely considered insecure: this corresponds to about 22 base64 characters.
-   A block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts blocks of a fixed length. The encryption function E transforms plaintext blocks P into ciphertext blocks C by using a secret key k.


### Stream Cipher {#stream-cipher}

-   A stream cipher is a `symmetric-key encryption` algorithm that encrypts a stream of bits.
-   Ideally, that stream could be as long as weʼd like; real-world stream ciphers have limits, but sufficient for practical use


### Stream vs Block {#stream-vs-block}

-   Several block ciphers have modes of operation that allow them to function in a streaming-like manner.
    -   Cipher Feedback (CFB)
    -   Output Feedback (OFB)
    -   Counter (CTR) etc.
-   With stream ciphers, we know(after encryption has happened) that certain metadata is at certain indices in the stream.
    -   `What do I know about the plaintext` and `what can I LEARN about the plaintext from observing the ciphertext` are two different things.
    -   This is a "priori knowledge". The fact that you used a stream cipher didn't change anything, but it also didn't leak anything.
    -   Stream cipher may seem less secure compared to a block cipher (In a block bits are sort of jumbled around &amp; don't have fixed position)
    -   But if we ensure `authenticity`, `integrity` ([HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}})), we're good. With stream cipher the attacker can know what could be where based on the protocol but does not know nothing about the actual data. So we all good.


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> MODES {#modes}


#### block {#block}

1.  ****Electronic Codebook (ECB):****
    -   Each block of plaintext is independently encrypted with the same key.
    -   Identical plaintext blocks result in identical ciphertext blocks.

2.  ****Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):****
    -   Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
    -   Initialization Vector (IV) is used for the first block to break patterns.

3.  ****Cipher Feedback (CFB):****
    -   Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.
    -   Previous ciphertext block is fed back into the block cipher to generate a keystream.

4.  ****Output Feedback (OFB):****
    -   Similar to CFB but the block cipher encrypts a constant value (IV) to produce a keystream.
    -   The keystream is then XORed with the plaintext.

5.  ****Counter (CTR):****
    -   Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.
    -   Uses a counter as the input to the block cipher to generate a keystream.
    -   The counter is usually combined with a nonce.

6.  ****Galois/Counter Mode (GCM):****
    -   Combines the counter mode of operation with Galois field multiplication.
    -   Provides both confidentiality and authenticity.
    -   Widely used for authenticated encryption.


#### Stream Cipher Modes: {#stream-cipher-modes}

1.  **Synchronous Stream Ciphers:**
    -   Keyed bits are generated to form a pseudorandom keystream.
    -   The keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.
2.  ****Self-Synchronizing Stream Ciphers:****
    -   Previous ciphertext bits are used to generate the next key bits.
    -   Allows synchronization even if some ciphertext bits are lost or corrupted.
3.  ****Stream Cipher with Feedback (SCFB):****
    -   Similar to CFB mode for block ciphers.
    -   Uses the previous ciphertext bits to generate the next keystream.
4.  ****Combining Generators:****
    -   Multiple keystream generators are combined to improve security.
5.  ****Filter Generators:****
    -   Combines a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with a nonlinear filter.


## Encryption in Practice {#encryption-in-practice}

> Encryption itself is vulnerable to tampering unless you combine it with authentication. Hence AEAD.


### Backup and data recovery {#backup-and-data-recovery}

More info [Could Age Replace OpenPGP? {The Call of the Open Sidewalk}](https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:agevspgp)


#### Bad data {#bad-data}

-   Different encryption tools like GPG and `age` may deal with this differently.
-   So good to check the integrity of the input file before attempting to do anything with it.
-   Example `age` : No data or partial data is better than bad data
    ```shell
    $ age -d -i key.txt -o totc_out.txt totc.txt.age
    Error: chacha20poly1305: message authentication failed
    [ Did age not do what you expected? Could an error be more useful? Tell us: https://filippo.io/age/report ]
    $ ls -l totc_out.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 operator  operator  0 Dec 25 12:53 totc_out.txt # zero length output!!
    ```
-   Example `gpg` : Partial bad data is better than no data
    ```shell
    $ gpg2 -d totc.txt.pgp >totc_out.txt
    gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID B456C3BB5A48A0EA, created 2020-06-01
          "BACKUP <backup@store>"
          gpg: WARNING: encrypted message has been manipulated!
    $ ls -l totc_out.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 operator  operator  807615 Dec 25 15:26 totc_out.txt
    ```


### Database data encryption {#database-data-encryption}

> -   The laziest solution to the “encrypted database” use-case is to just use deterministic encryption, such as AES-ECB or with a static IV/nonce. (NOT GOOD)
> -   DO: Encrypt securely (i.e. AEAD with random nonces).


#### AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) {#aead--authenticated-encryption-with-associated-data}

> encryption scheme that ensures both confidentiality and authenticity of the data. + allows you to associate extra authenticated but un-encrypted data.

-   It's a construction
    -   Main idea is: Encrypt-then-MAC
    -   But by using combined algorithms such as `ChaCha20-Poly1305`, it makes the "Encrypt-then-MAC" step into one and makes things easier for us.
-   Components
    1.  Encryption: Symmetric key (Eg. AES, `ChaCha20`)
    2.  Authentication: [HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}}) or `Poly1305`
    3.  Extra associated  data
