## Why 64K page? {#why-64k-page}


### Advantage {#advantage}

-   It's all about performance.
-   When a virtual memory page has to be attached to the VAS, if a page fault occurs, it's handled by the OS. So 64K will give you less page faults than 4K simply because of the size of the page.
-   For the same reason as huge pages, TLB also benifits.


### Disadvantage {#disadvantage}

-   Memory fragmentation. Eg. many memory allocators have page alignment constraints for convenience, which could waste up to the remaining 60K if the memory actually in use fits entirely within a 4K page instead.
