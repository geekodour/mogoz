## FAQ {#faq}


### short uuid? {#short-uuid}

-   These are basically encodings. Eg. You could base62 encode a random number.
-   Under the hood, it's uuid data only referring to the 4122RFC.
-   But the string representation is independent can be base32/64 whatever.
-   Short uuids and similar are nothing but different string representations.
-   Eg. nanoid, squid etc.


### millisecond? {#millisecond}

-   It’s better not to store the exact millisecond an ID was generated, but instead fuzz the nearest second and add a counter.


## Types {#types}

### timestamp based id {#timestamp-based-id}

-   ids generated at the same time are close to each other when sorted
-   Eg. UUIDv7, ULID, ksuid, xid


### sequential Ids {#sequential-ids}

-   Incremental IDs etc.


### random ids {#random-ids}

-   UUIDv4


### non-coordinated unique ids {#non-coordinated-unique-ids}

-   These are useful in [Distributed Systems]({{< relref "20221102130004-distributed_systems.md" >}})


## UUID {#uuid}


### What {#what}

-   Generated via random or time-based means
-   128-bit label value (expressed as 32 hex-characters)
    -   `5 sections` containing 32b, 16b, 16b, 16b, and 48b
        -   `93f9a654-7467-46de-9964-f30a66104dd9`


### Variants {#variants}


#### Original RFC {#original-rfc}

See [RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)

-   v1: computer's MAC
-   v2: guaranteed to be unique if at most one is generated per computer about every 7 minutes
-   v3: deterministic based on the supplied input
-   v5: deterministic based on the supplied input
-   v4: non-deterministic UUIDs. (this is usually what ppl refer to)

    -   version and variant is fixed. variant can only be `8 (1000), 9 (1001), a (1010), or b (1011)`
    -   These are great when we want to split on random keys, but not great for btree performances like clustered indexes etc.

#### Draft {#draft}

See [draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-04](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format). These use `time bits + random bits`. With these, you get the same sortability as a sequential ID with the flexibility of distributed generation. (sorting at creation time!)

-   v6: time bit is set by something else
-   v7: time bit is set by unix epoch
    ![](/ox-hugo/20230801145421-uuid-100145676.png)
    -   If you can configure how precise you get. `More precision => Less random bits`
    -   UUIDv7 generated now is always going to be larger than a UUIDv7 generated a millisecond ago.
    -   The `timestamp+monotonic seq. counter` is only relevant for UUIDs generated on the same machine within the `same millisecond`
        -   it will not ensure ordering if they're generated in diff machines in the `same millisecond`
        -   `061ff8d8-e24b-7000-8092-ca1e5440d491` and `061ff8d8-e24b-7001-b653-1c41e471cd78` are 2 uuids generated in the `same millisecond` so we have the change in the monotonic seq. counter.
-   v8: time bit is set by something else


## ULID {#ulid}


### What {#what}

![](/ox-hugo/20230801145421-uuid-2101883927.png)
Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier

-   Not an RFC but spec can be found [here](https://github.com/ulid/spec)
-   A ULID is a 128-bit label, just like a UUID.
    -   Instead of hexadecimal in UUID, ULID uses Crockford's Base 32 encoded string.
    -   Eg. `017eb31e-1440-b69e-d82f-5f0937f823c8` (hex) -&gt; `0GWWXY2G84DFMRVWQNJ1SRYCMC` (crockford)
-   No special characters (URL safe)
-   ULIDs are monotonically increasing like `UUIDv7` but there's no defined monotonic counter. They have seq random sections.
    -   Eg. `017ece40-2a1e-63ac-a58d-e336f30c1d76` and `017ece40-2a1e-63ac-a58d-e336f30c1d77`, 2 ULIDs generated in same millisecond.


### Concerns {#concerns}

-   Guarantees ordering up to millisecond precision.
-   Most implementation additionally guarantee ordering of the 80 random bits for absolute ordering but only IN PROCESS.
-   If you have many clients concurrently producing data and generating ULIDs you can run into out-of-order rows.
-   One use case of ULIDs is as event IDs in distributed systems.
    -   **BUT** ULIDs are not meant as a replacement for a lamport timestamp or something.
-   Atleast with [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}), ULIDs [are slower to generate](https://blog.daveallie.com/ulid-primary-keys) than UUIDs.

## Other schemes {#other-schemes}


### ksuid {#ksuid}

-   uses 160 bits. A 32-bit timestamp and then 128 bits of random-based payload.
-   sortable via its string representation as well.


### xid {#xid}

-   iteration on Mongo’s ObjectId


### squid {#squid}

-   [Sqids (formerly Hashids) · Generate Short IDs from Numbers](https://sqids.org/)
-   These IDs are short, can be generated from a custom alphabet and are guaranteed to be collision-free.
-   Main usecase is purely visual. Can be hashed back.
