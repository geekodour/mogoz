> In my experience of reading articles and discussions related to Message Passing, it's apparent that the terms are not used very consistently. So don't make the mistake of being too pedantic about these terms, esp technologies.

## Messaging Patterns {#messaging-patterns}


### Direct to Endpoint {#direct-to-endpoint}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230404153903-message_passing-841308762.png" >}}

-   P2P communications of microservices building a deathstar like architecture
-   Everything is linked and effectively youâ€™ll end up with a distributed monolith.
-   This is generally not so good
-   These 3 blogposts make a good overview about it

#### Issues with DoE {#issues-with-doe}

-   So basically there are tradefoffs
-   Retry logic: in the event of failed consumers/slow consumers
-   What guarantees that service is reachable and working as intended?
-   Guaranteed delivery?
-   What if a lot of systems want to be listening, you'll have to bake in that logic into the producer. Non-DOE systems help decouple this.


### Pub/sub {#pub-sub}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230404153903-message_passing-1916366525.png" >}}

-   Multiple subscribers can consume the same message from the same topic.


### Queue {#queue}

-   For multiple consumers, we need to set up separate queues. Different implementations have different ways of making this happen.


### Others {#others}


## Message Queue (MQ) {#message-queue--mq}

-   One of more popular [Messaging Patterns](#messaging-patterns)
-   Async communication on an infrastructural level
-   The `Queue` itself is just a data structure/container and usually needs a `Broker` (Queue Manager)
-   This is different from distributed [Task Queue]({{< relref "20230404163634-task_queue.md" >}}), Message Queue compliment Task queues.


### Message Broker (Queue Manager) {#message-broker--queue-manager}

Sort of middleware that can handle things like routing, validate, store, handle backpressure, deliver stuff etc.


### Polling {#polling}

-   User submits a request via the web application
-   Backend handles that message by adding a message to the message queue.
-   Consumer gets message, makes HTTP call to another web service to actually submit the request.
-   **From there, the polling logic takes over**
-   Subsequent messages on the queue each represent a polling attempt to retrieve the results.
-   If job has no results, consumer places message back on the queue
    -   We can delay the next polling attempt (configurable).
    -   Delay logic can use TTL and dead letter definitions etc.


### Error Handling {#error-handling}


#### Fail Fast {#fail-fast}

Bail out


#### Dead Letter Queue {#dead-letter-queue}

-   Failed messages will be written to a DLQ
-   Now you can inspect items in the DLQ and after making any required changes you can now re-process the message from the DLQ
-   Almost always needs manual intervention or code to handle stuff written to DLQ


## Implementations {#implementations}

Different implementations have different tradefoff, I am just listing random things. Analyze the situation at hand and decide for yourself. Different implementations can support/not support different message passing patterns.


### Brokerless {#brokerless}


#### ZMQ (ZeroMQ) {#zmq--zeromq}

-   zmq is a communication library, not an application.
-   Also useful for communications between services on single server
-   It's like sockets on steroids.


#### NanoMQ {#nanomq}

Original Nanomsg is abandoned. There's [nng](https://nng.nanomsg.org/) which is a lightweight, broker-less library. People on the internet say it's inferior to ZMQ.


### Broker {#broker}


#### RabbitMQ {#rabbitmq}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230404153903-message_passing-1856019865.png" >}}

-   A message router but can be tricky to administer.
-   Supported protocols: AMQP, HTTP, WS, STOMP, MQTT
-   Has 1:1, 1:N and [others](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html)
-   Good
    -   if retention and streaming is not a requirement
    -   For long-running tasks
    -   A needs to notify another B about something
-   Cautionary Tales
    -   You probably want to use a wrapper library
    -   Watchout for `partion_handling`
    -   Think about how to handle upgrades and restarts etc.


#### Redis {#redis}

-   See [Redis]({{< relref "20230406214230-redis.md" >}})
-   The message queue/ pub sub feature of Redis is a secondary use case. Hence, abilities are simpler than RabbitMQ.
-   But it [can be used](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/index.html) as a [message queue](https://redis.io/commands/lmove/)


#### Others {#others}

-   ActiveMQ
-   SQS/SNS
-   Google Pub/Sub


### Distributed Broker {#distributed-broker}


#### Kafka {#kafka}

-   See [Kafka]({{< relref "20230210012126-kafka.md" >}})
-   It's an event stream processing software/distributed log.
-   It is used to stream data in the order it arrives, effectively, in a fault tolerant way.
-   It **has disk persistence**, but not designed for [zero data loss](https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2018/9/14/how-to-lose-messages-on-a-kafka-cluster-part1)
-   Misconceptions
    -   It's a broker, not a data lake. (Not designed to batch loads at all times, will affect processing)
    -   Your app doesn't have to be a collection of microservices in order to use Kafka. One can apply CQRS using Kafka on a monolith application but it's usually done to eventually move towards microservices architecture.
    -   **Not a message queue**
        -   You [can build queue on top of it](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/reliable-reprocessing/), but you need to implement a lot of logic yourself.
        -   Durable message queue (due to persistence)


#### Pulsar {#pulsar}

-   Supports [all of the](https://anuradhaneo.medium.com/kafka-is-not-the-best-anymore-meet-pulsar-9eb435c9fc0b) messaging patterns such as streaming, pubsub, and queues (Kafka doesn't support certain queue patterns).


#### NATS {#nats}

-   Started as high performance pub/sub
-   Now a Kafka competitor w Jetstream(persistent log streams)


#### NSQ {#nsq}

-   [NSQ - A realtime distributed messaging platform](https://nsq.io/)
-   No builtin support for replication, Looses in-memory things if crashes
-   Pub/Sub


### Others {#others}

-   [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "20221102123302-postgresql.md" >}}) via NOTIFY/LISTEN, This is [sort of an anti-pattern](https://dagster.io/blog/skip-kafka-use-postgres-message-queue).
-   If you want the single binary with no JVM, Redpanda will likely serve you well.


## Protocol {#protocol}

See [Custom Protocols]({{< relref "20230221012237-custom_protocols.md" >}})


### AMQP {#amqp}

-   It's a [feature-rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol) message queue binary protocol, that [brokers](https://www.rabbitmq.com/protocols.html) can use.


### MQTT (Protocol) {#mqtt--protocol}

-   Lightweight message queue protocol especially for embedded devices
-   A pub/sub platform
