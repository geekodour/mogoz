## What? {#what}

-   Codec stands for `code/decode`
-   It's a reversible method for converting interesting things into completely uninteresting and useless numbers â€¦ and then converting those uninteresting and useless numbers back into interesting things again.


## A streaming codec loop {#a-streaming-codec-loop}

-   Protocols wrap protocols. Binary protocols boils down to:
    -   Getting how many bytes are coming next
    -   Writing the buffer with `the meaning of the data(meaningless to the protocol itself)`.
-   Start by writing two threads, `TcpListener` and the other has a `TcpStream` that connects to the listener
-   Have them send messages back and forth that begin with 8 byte fixed-size `frame delimiters`.
    -   The `frame delimiter` says how many bytes are coming.
-   The `codec loop` is trivial
    -   Read 8 bytes, turn it into a `u64`
    -   Read that many bytes into a new buffer that will be interpreted as the actual message.
    -   Eg. `2 a b 3 a b c 1 a` will turn into 3 messages: `ab`, `abc`, `a`.
-   A `Frame` is essentially `(size, message)`, these can be refereed to as "framed protocols".
