## Limits {#limits}

> Basic idea: When \\(x\\) is approaching the some number, **what is \\(f(x)\\)/\\(y\\)/the function approaching**?

-   For \\(f(x)=\frac{x-1}{x-1}; f(x)=1, x\ne1\\) i.e there is a discontinuity.
-   \\(\lim\limits\_{x\to1}\frac{x-1}{x-1}=1\\) means that \\(f(x)\\) is also approaching 1 as \\(x\\) is approaching 1.

Another example,

\\(g(x)=\begin{cases}  x^2,x\ne2\\\  1,x=2 \end{cases}\\)

-   \\(\lim\limits\_{x\to2}g(x)=4\\) means that \\(g(x)\\) is approaching 4 as \\(x\\) is approaching 2.
-   But we can see that as soon as \\(x\\) is 2, \\(g(x)\\) will be \\(1\\).
