## FAQ {#faq}


### Partial Quorum {#partial-quorum}


### Consensus is NOT for [Scaling]({{< relref "20230608143206-scaling_databases.md" >}}) {#consensus-is-not-for-scaling--20230608143206-scaling-databases-dot-md}

> The way that horizontally scaling databases like Cockroach or Yugabyte or Spanner work is by sharding the data, transparent to the client. Within each shard data is replicated with a dedicated distributed consensus cluster.
>
> So, yes, distributed consensus can be a part of horizontal scaling. But again what distributed `consensus primarily solves is high availability via replication` while remaining linearizable.
>
> This is not a trivial point to make. etcd, consul, and rqlite are examples of databases that do not do sharding, only replication, via a single Raft cluster that replicates all data for the entire system.
>
> For these databases there is no horizontal scaling. If they support "horizontal scaling", they support this by doing non-linearizable (stale) reads. Writes remain a challenge.

### Viewstamped Replication Protocol {#viewstamped-replication-protocol}


#### VR vs Raft {#vr-vs-raft}

-   Viewstamped Replication relies on [Message Passing]({{< relref "20230404153903-message_passing.md" >}}), while RAFT relies on RPC
-   "VSR is also described in terms of message passing, whereas Raft took VSRâ€™s original message passing and coupled it to RPCâ€”shutting out things like multipath routing and leaving the logical networking protocol misaligned to the underlying physical network fault model." - Joran
-   Comparing the 2012 VSR and 2014 Raft papers, they are remarkably similar.
-   VSR better in prod than raft (opinion)
    -   Itâ€™s all the little things. All the quality, clear thinking and crisp terminology coming from Liskov, Oki and Cowling.
    -   Okiâ€™s VSR was literally the first to pioneer consensus in â€˜88, so itâ€™s well aged, and the â€˜12 revision again by Liskov and Cowling is a great vintage!
