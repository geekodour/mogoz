## API Endpoint security {#api-endpoint-security}


### Tokens {#tokens}

-   An authorization token is just a string that is used to authorize a request.
-   It can be
    -   A JSON Web Token (so-called pass-by-value tokens)
    -   A random identifier (so-called pass-by-reference tokens)
    -   Something else
-   In the wild they call it, API keys, Personal access tokens etc. These are **not necessarily** outcome of the OAuth Flow.
-   You can use API gateways such as


### OAuth and Protecting APIs {#oauth-and-protecting-apis}

-   OAuth is abused as a way of protecting your API but still widely used.
-   Use the `Authorization Code grant` if there is a **human being** involved.
-   Use the `Client Credentials grant` if you are performing **server to server** communication.
-   Benefits of using OAuth in APIs
    -   Time limited (rotation built in).
    -   If using signed tokens, integrity of contents can be verified.
    -   Lots of libraries and knowledge around how to use it.
    -   Tokens allow for more interesting/useful payloads than an API key.
-   [OAuth (Open Authorization)]({{< relref "20230301205620-authorization.md#oauth--open-authorization" >}}) access tokens are a subcategory of tokens

### Exposing API {#exposing-api}

-   API gateways like [Kong](https://github.com/kong/kong)
-   Custom service


### Native APIs {#native-apis}

-   One can use session tokens to [access native APIs.](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/session/)


## Protecting API {#protecting-api}

This comes down to a data question

-   If data is personal: Implement some sort of authentication and authorization
-   If the data is public: Run on the assumption someone will find a way to extract it. Tools like CORS mainly exist to make life harder, but it's not difficult to trick if you want to especially on the server side. You can use things like API gateways, track the usage pattern of requests, rate limit to a point where automated data extraction is too slow. However all of these have work arounds.


## Cookies {#cookies}


### Cross domain requests {#cross-domain-requests}

-   Frontend hosted at: `examples.xyz`
-   Backend hosted at: `api.examples.com`
-   Configure `samesite` attribute correctly on the cookie
-   Configure [CORS]({{< relref "20230302210256-cors.md" >}}) on the API
