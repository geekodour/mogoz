## Random topics {#random-topics}

-   window functions
-   inequality joins
-   quantile functions
-   "say you have a dataset in a SQL table, and you find there are duplicates in it that shouldn't be there. walk me through how you'd resolve this issue"
    -   I've also encountered the same thing, but with constraints added every time you come up with a solution.
    -   Whay if the table has a billion rows, would that affect your solution?
    -   What if you need to ensure it completes before every full hour?
    -   What if new data arrives continuously?
