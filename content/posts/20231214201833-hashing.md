## FAQ {#faq}


### Are collisions expected? {#are-collisions-expected}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231214201833-hashing-1997300410.png" >}}

-   Yes, because `input` can be any string, but the number returned is `within some promised range`, it's possible that two different inputs can return the same number. This itself is the definition of an collision.
-   Good hash functions try to minimise how many collisions they produce. It's not possible to completely eliminate collisions.
-   We have ways to handle collisions, when they occur.
-   Few hash functions are collision-free, but most are designed so that collisions are minimized. See [Perfect hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function)


### Avalanche Effect {#avalanche-effect}

-   Refers to how many bits in the output value change when just a single bit of the input changes.
-   To say that a hash function has a good avalanche effect, a single bit flip in the input should result in an average of 50% the output bits flipping.


### Non-Crypographic hashes? {#non-crypographic-hashes}

-   Can be reversed using various methods, including brute-force attacks, rainbow table attacks, or other techniques depending on the specific hash function and its design.


### Is MD5 cryptographic hash or no? {#is-md5-cryptographic-hash-or-no}

-   Originally it was a cryptographic hash function but later attacks were shown
-   Now its popularly used for non-cryptographic usage

### MAC and HMAC {#mac-and-hmac}

See [HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}})


## Types by usage {#types-by-usage}

-   See [The many flavors of hashing -- Volution Notes](https://notes.volution.ro/v1/2022/07/notes/1290a79c/#integrity-hashes)
-   See [Use Fast Data Algorithms | Joey Lynch's Site](https://jolynch.github.io/posts/use_fast_data_algorithms/) (You might as-well use something other than md5)

### Shuffling/Lookup hashes/Similar {#shuffling-lookup-hashes-similar}

-   What: Given an input, return a small number (16, 32, or 64 bits).
-   performance for small inputs
-   Eg. xxh3/xxh128/highwayhash/SipHash/djb2/Murmur3 (See [comparision](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/wiki/Performance-comparison))
    -   SipHash is mostly used as the hash function in hash-table implementation in most programming languages
-   Usage
    -   Implementing data structures like `hash tables`
        -   Use a hash function to determine which bucket an item belongs to(evenly distribute items among the buckets)
        -   Converting a key into an index for memory addresses when constructing hash tables
    -   Classifying inputs into a small number of buckets in sharding (see [Scaling Databases]({{< relref "20230608143206-scaling_databases.md" >}}))
    -   Can be used for storage, but for storage, usually cryptographically strong hashes are used.
-   Tips
    -   Do not use for security
    -   If input is controlled by user, [consider using seed/key](https://darksi.de/12.hashwick-v8-vulnerability/).
    -   Expect regular collisions
    -   Go with [prime number](https://lobste.rs/s/uvmp4j/good_hash_table_primes) or [powers of 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53526790/why-are-hashmaps-implemented-using-powers-of-two) (avoids expensive modulo operations) for bucket count.


#### Find similar items hashes {#find-similar-items-hashes}

-   Text: Soundex / metaphone / doublemetaphone.
-   Images: ahash/phash/dhash/whash/blockmeat/colormoment/colorhas/marrHildreth/[Perceptual hashing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing)
    -   perceptual hash functions do not provide the same properties as cryptographic hash functions.

-   Digest: MD5


### Integrity hashes {#integrity-hashes}

-   Not cryptographic
-   Eg. CRC, MD5


### Signature Hashes/Crypographic Hashes/Secure hashes {#signature-hashes-crypographic-hashes-secure-hashes}

-   See [Cryptographic and Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions · Dadario's Blog](https://dadario.com.br/cryptographic-and-non-cryptographic-hash-functions/)
-   Even theoretically 'broken' ones like MD5, these hashes exhibit distribution that's indistinguishable from randomness
-   Non-invertible and must be resistant to
    -   Collision attacks
    -   Preimage attacks
-   Larger output size than general hashing functions
-   Eg. BLAKE3, SHA256(with [HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}})).
-   Whether or not cryptographic hash functions are truly one-way functions is like P vs NP ([Complexity Theory]({{< relref "20230422182641-complexity_theory.md" >}}))
-   Not to be used for password hashes, to be used with libraries like libsodium etc.


### Key Derivation Hashes (KDF) / Token Hash {#key-derivation-hashes--kdf--token-hash}

-   See [PKI]({{< relref "20230417085602-pki.md" >}})
-   Taking a known (and secret) key to generate any number of unguessable tokens.
-   It is possible to construct a public key signature using a cryptographic hash as the only underlying primitive. These can be proven secure based on the usual assumptions about the security of the underlying cryptographic hash.
-   A major drawback is that they are expensive to compute, and the signatures require a huge number of bits compared to other public key algorithms.
-   Example
    -   HKDF is a valid KDF (stricter requirements than a PRF, Based on [HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}}))
        -   [Understanding HKDF - Dhole Moments](https://soatok.blog/2021/11/17/understanding-hkdf/)
    -   Blake3


### Password Hashing {#password-hashing}

-   This is similar to KDF
-   When users are sending a username and password over HTTP
-   Not all password hashes are meant for key derivation. Eg. bcrypt should not be used for KDF. (Argon2 and scrypt) can be safely used as a password hashing function or as a KDF.
-   Eg. Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt. (See [Aaron Toponce : Let's Talk Password Hashing](https://web.archive.org/web/20220224155029/https://pthree.org/2016/06/28/lets-talk-password-hashing/))


### Encryption {#encryption}

-   Hashes are used as `mixing functions` in [encryption]({{< relref "20230417114522-encryption.md" >}})
-   But you can also trivially turn a hash function into a cipher and encrypt with it (apologies if I missed an explanation of this in the article). Just hash a key and a counter together to create a keystream and XOR your plaintext to it. That's how Salsa20 and ChaCha20 work.
