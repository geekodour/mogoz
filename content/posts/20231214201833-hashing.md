## FAQ {#faq}


### Are collisions expected? {#are-collisions-expected}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20231214201833-hashing-1997300410.png" >}}

-   Yes, because `input` can be any string, but the number returned is `within some promised range`, it's possible that two different inputs can return the same number. This itself is the definition of an collision.
-   Good hash functions try to minimise how many collisions they produce. It's not possible to completely eliminate collisions.
-   We have ways to handle collisions, when they occur.
-   Few hash functions are collision-free, but most are designed so that collisions are minimized. See [Perfect hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function)


### Avalanche Effect {#avalanche-effect}

-   Refers to how many bits in the output value change when just a single bit of the input changes.
-   To say that a hash function has a good avalanche effect, a single bit flip in the input should result in an average of 50% the output bits flipping.


### Non-Crypographic hashes? {#non-crypographic-hashes}

-   Can be reversed using various methods, including brute-force attacks, rainbow table attacks, or other techniques depending on the specific hash function and its design.


### Is MD5 cryptographic hash or no? {#is-md5-cryptographic-hash-or-no}

-   Originally it was a cryptographic hash function but later attacks were shown
-   Now its popularly used for non-cryptographic usage


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Length Extension Attack? what it do with HMAC? {#length-extension-attack-what-it-do-with-hmac}


### MAC and HMAC {#mac-and-hmac}

See [HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}})


## Types by usage {#types-by-usage}

### Shuffling/Lookup hashes/Similar {#shuffling-lookup-hashes-similar}

-   What: Given an input, return a small number (16, 32, or 64 bits).
-   performance for small inputs
-   Eg. xxh3/xxh128/highwayhash/SipHash/djb2/Murmur3 (See [comparision](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/wiki/Performance-comparison))
    -   SipHash is mostly used as the hash function in hash-table implementation in most programming languages
-   Usage
    -   Implementing data structures like `hash tables`
        -   Use a hash function to determine which bucket an item belongs to(evenly distribute items among the buckets)
        -   Converting a key into an index for memory addresses when constructing hash tables
    -   Classifying inputs into a small number of buckets in sharding (see [Scaling Databases]({{< relref "20230608143206-scaling_databases.md" >}}))
    -   Can be used for storage, but for storage, usually cryptographically strong hashes are used.
-   Tips
    -   Do not use for security
    -   If input is controlled by user, [consider using seed/key](https://darksi.de/12.hashwick-v8-vulnerability/).
    -   Expect regular collisions
    -   Go with [prime number](https://lobste.rs/s/uvmp4j/good_hash_table_primes) or [powers of 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53526790/why-are-hashmaps-implemented-using-powers-of-two) (avoids expensive modulo operations) for bucket count.

-   Audio: acoustid
-   Digest: MD5


### Integrity hashes {#integrity-hashes}

> Checksums based on these hash functions cannot be 100% reliable due to the possibility of collisions. They provide a probabilistic guarantee of integrity, not an absolute one.

-   Usually not cryptographic, Eg. CRC, MD5, xxh3
    -   In modern systems, go w xxh3 for performance advantages etc.
-   We can use cryptographic hash functions as integrity hashes(they'll be slower) if there's a strong need for collision resistance but usually non-cryptographic functions suffice.


### Signature Hashes/Cryptographic Hashes/Secure hashes {#signature-hashes-cryptographic-hashes-secure-hashes}

-   See [Cryptographic and Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions · Dadario's Blog](https://dadario.com.br/cryptographic-and-non-cryptographic-hash-functions/)
-   Even theoretically 'broken' ones like MD5, these hashes exhibit distribution that's indistinguishable from randomness
-   Non-invertible and must be resistant to
    -   Collision attacks (but doesn't have to be collision free)
    -   Preimage attacks
-   Larger output size than general hashing functions
-   Eg. BLAKE3, SHA256(with [HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}})).
-   Whether or not cryptographic hash functions are truly one-way functions is like P vs NP ([Complexity Theory]({{< relref "20230422182641-complexity_theory.md" >}}))
-   Not to be used for password hashes, to be used with libraries like libsodium etc.


## Usecases of hash functions {#usecases-of-hash-functions}


### Key Derivation Hashes (KDF) / Token Hash &amp; Password hashing {#key-derivation-hashes--kdf--token-hash-and-password-hashing}


-   Taking a known (and secret) key to generate any number of unguessable tokens.
    -   `Input (password) -> KDF -> Derived Key`
-   They're like cryptographic hashing algorithms but with:
    1.  Salt: A random value added to the input to prevent rainbow table attacks.
    2.  Iteration Count: Number of times the function is applied, increasing computational cost.
    3.  Memory-Hard Function: Some modern KDFs use memory-intensive operations.
-   Example
    -   HKDF is a valid KDF (stricter requirements than a PRF, Based on [HMAC]({{< relref "20231215104223-hmac.md" >}}))
        -   [Understanding HKDF - Dhole Moments](https://soatok.blog/2021/11/17/understanding-hkdf/)
    -   Blake3


#### How is KDF and [PKI]({{< relref "20230417085602-pki.md" >}}) different? {#how-is-kdf-and-pki--20230417085602-pki-dot-md--different}

> They're not really related, but you could build a [PKI]({{< relref "20230417085602-pki.md" >}}) with KDF if you wanted

-   It is possible to construct a public key signature using a cryptographic hash as the only underlying primitive.
-   These can be proven secure based on the usual assumptions about the security of the underlying cryptographic hash.
-   A major drawback is that they are expensive to compute, and the signatures require a huge number of bits compared to other public key algorithms.


### Password Hashing {#password-hashing}

-   This is essentially KDF applied to passwords
-   BUT
    -   In password hashing, we don't like fast hashing functions, because password crackers do like fast hashing functions. The faster they can do, the sooner they can recover the password.
-   `DIFFERENCE with KDF`
    -   specifically designed password hashing functions, where a custom work factor is included as a cost.
        -   These have a `work factor`
    -   digest length can be arbitrary with KDFs, whereas password hashing functions will have a `fixed length output`.
-   Eg. Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2.


### Encryption {#encryption}

-   See [Encryption]({{< relref "20230417114522-encryption.md" >}})
-   Hashes are used as `mixing functions` in [encryption]({{< relref "20230417114522-encryption.md" >}})
-   But you can also trivially turn a hash function into a [Cipher]({{< relref "20230417114522-encryption.md#cipher" >}}) and encrypt with it (apologies if I missed an explanation of this in the article). Just hash a key and a counter together to create a keystream and XOR your plaintext to it. That's how Salsa20 and ChaCha20 work.

## Properties of hash functions {#properties-of-hash-functions}

See HashMap in [Data Structures]({{< relref "20230403192236-data_structures.md" >}}). Hashmap/Hashtable use a hash function to determine the collision.

### Collision free vs Collision resistant &amp; Birthday Paradox {#collision-free-vs-collision-resistant-and-birthday-paradox}

-   Due to the `pigeonhole principle`, collisions "must exist" for any hash function that maps a larger input space to a smaller output space.
-   cryptographic hash function need to be `collision restistant` NOT `collision free`
    -   i.e the computational in-feasibility of finding a collision from the output.
-   Due to the `birthday paradox`, collisions can be found more easily than one might intuitively expect.
    -   For an n-bit hash, the probability of finding a collision becomes significant after about 2^(n/2) hashes, rather than 2^n.
    -   For 64-bit, with 2^32 files hashed
        -   There's a 50% chance that at least two of those files will have the same hash value.
        -   The 50% probability refers to the chance of any collision existing among the 2^32 files, not the likelihood of a new file colliding.
        -   TODO: Need to be more clear on the math here
-   Solution:
    -   Use larger hash sizes to reduce collision probability based on requirement
    -   Combine multiple hash functions for more robust checksums.
