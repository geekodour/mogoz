## FAQ {#faq}


### ZFS vs LVM {#zfs-vs-lvm}

-   LVM is a volume manager and you'll need a filesystem on top of it.
-   ZFS is both a volume manager and a filesystem. You can make changes later on as with LVM.
-   LVM and ZFS should (probably) be not used together for double COW?


### ZFS vs btrfs {#zfs-vs-btrfs}


### ZFS on linux {#zfs-on-linux}

> For various reasons I would not recommend ZFS on Linux: "poor" kernel integration (with poor I mean it does not always integrate well; architectural challenges, not bad code), not feature complete (compared to \*BSD/Solaris), eg. it does not support reflinks, (GPL licensing issues)

-   [ZFS on Linux and Amazon EC2 - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/71125/zfs-on-linux-and-amazon-ec2)
-   Because ZFS on linux has some issues, ideally (confirm status), so might just go LVM+ext4+linux


### ZFS vs Ceph {#zfs-vs-ceph}

-   Ceph on top of ZFS =&gt; not much value
-   ZFS on top of Ceph =&gt; [can be useful](https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/ptdqdn/zfs_and_ceph/), eg. zfs can help with compression
