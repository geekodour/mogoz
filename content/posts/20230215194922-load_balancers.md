## Basics {#basics}

Load balancing is a vague term. but common categorization

-   DNS: GSLB and such.
-   Network: Network devices sending traffic to multiple next-hops based on equal cost routing. The next-hops can be another layer of load balancer, or the end destination (in which case it’s anycast).
-   L4: They look at the “layer 4” headers to make a decision and forward each flow. These are smart, do consistent hashing, so if a destination goes down flows not going to that one still go to the same endpoint. They often have health-checks etc. Basically can have logic.
-   L7: These look higher in the network stack, often at HTTP headers and the like. Frequently they’ll do TLS offload. These can do compplicated stuff.
