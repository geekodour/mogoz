## How memory works {#how-memory-works}

-   When you attempt to recall some knowledge from memory, the act of "retrieval" reinforce those memories. Don't think about your ex.
-   The learning produced by retrieval is called the “testing effect”. This is more about producing [learning]({{< relref "20220625160938-learning.md" >}}) rather than accessing learning.
-   If things are in your memory and you're doing creative work, it'll help me get into flow faster
-   Salience(Notability) typically fades over time. If you don’t soon have a chance to connect that new idea to something meaningful in your life, you may stop noticing opportunities so readily. SRS helps us leverage Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.


## Writing better prompts {#writing-better-prompts}

This is summarization of [this article](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/).


### Type of information {#type-of-information}


#### Factual {#factual}

-   Closed list, almost like an equation
-   Not about just being able to answer factual question
-   The idea has to spontaneously occur to you when it’s useful


#### Procedural {#procedural}

-   Explanation prompts are helpful, avoid rote learning and build a deeper understanding


#### Conceptual {#conceptual}

To internalize a concept, you need to understand its components and relationships. You can use the following lenses when constructing a prompt for a concept but **you don't necessarily have to use** all of them.

-   Attributes and tendencies
-   Similarities and differences
-   Parts and wholes
-   Causes and effects
-   Significance and implications


#### Practical {#practical}

-   Open lists: These are like tags(not anki tag). With this, you connect new ideas to old ones
-   Prompt: Focused on tagged items, linking instance-tag.
-   Prompt: About the tag itself, perhaps patterns etc.
-   Prompt: Fuzzy links by examples.


### Basic guidelines {#basic-guidelines}

-   You are giving your future self a "recurring" task
-   Prompts should collectively invoke retrieval practice of all the key details
-   **Don't do** pattern matching, even if it's a cloze. You are recalling the knowledge not the pattern to fill. Just balance it out.
-   **Don't do** binary prompts(Y/N). Better rephrase them as open ended questions, usually means linking it some example/implication.
-   **Don't** disrupt your review session if something wrong w the prompt, SRS apps allow "flagging". Use that feature and modify the prompt later, maybe holistically.
-   Optimize prompts for the "emotional connection" w your review session


#### Skills needed {#skills-needed}

1.  How to break things down to things that we need to know
2.  How to construct questions, that'll reinforce that knowledge (This involves interpretation)


#### Process of writing {#process-of-writing}

-   Iterative
    -   Since you are not sure what's important, it's hard to write good prompts on your first exposure to new ideas.
    -   Write iteratively. Come back, writing more prompts as you understand what’s most relevant.
-   When?
    -   Whenever you feel it
    -   While you read (for simple topics)
    -   In batch, after reading/highlighting (for topics that doing anki back and forth might be disruptive)
-   How much?
    -   Don't try to economize on prompts. Write more prompts than feels natural.
    -   No deep virtue in writing a prompt about every detail. Keep things limited to your curiosity, usefulness and interest


### Prompt types {#prompt-types}

-   Retrieval prompts
-   Creative prompts


#### Properties for retrieval prompts {#properties-for-retrieval-prompts}

<div class="warning small-text">

> -   Achieving these properties is mostly about writing **tightly-scoped questions**
> -   Important to break knowledge down into its discrete components
> -   SRS schedule will build those pieces back up as prompts
</div>

-   **Focused**: Q/A involving too much detail will dull concentration and do incomplete retrievals
-   **Precise**: Should be precise about what they’re asking for
-   **Consistent**: Should produce consistent answers. i.e lighting the same bulbs everytime.
-   **Tractable**: To avoid interference/churn/annoyance in your review sessions, write prompts which you can almost always answer correctly. Way to do is by **adding cues**
-   **Effortful**: Should actually involves retrieving the answer from memory


#### Properties of creative prompts {#properties-of-creative-prompts}

-   Objective is not memory but to change behavior and invoke new thoughts
-   Creative prompts are more like a textbook exercise. Goal itself is to avoid retrieval.
-   You remember information better when you generated it yourself. (generation effect)


## Using `org-anki` {#using-org-anki}

-   Uses [Anki-Connect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/)


### It supports tags {#it-supports-tags}

```org
# * some title :tags_go_here:
#   :PROPERTIES:
#   :ANKI_NOTE_ID: XXX
#   :END:
#   Stuff here
```


### It supports the hierarchy that I need {#it-supports-the-hierarchy-that-i-need}

-   I use files to divide the topics
-   Further the topic can be sub divided into headings
-   When you run `org-anki-sync-all` It'll also update all the headings including the one that you don't want a card created for.
-   You can go back to that particular heading, and run `org-anki-delete-entry` and you should be good.

<!--listend-->

```org
# * primary title (we don't want card for this)
# ** secondary title
#    :PROPERTIES:
#    :ANKI_NOTE_ID: XXX
#    :END:
#    Stuff here
```


### Does not support (yet) {#does-not-support--yet}

-   Automatic skipping of headings (I might send a PR)
-   Images
-   cloze w back


## Using ChatGPT for Anki prompts {#using-chatgpt-for-anki-prompts}

I created a template for `basic` (F&amp;B) anki cards, it generates decent results.

```text
Create flashcards in the following format according to the guidelines and examples based on the info section below:

Format:
Create anki flashcards in this format:
- Front of the card(question) is the first line, also put a "*" infront as a prefix
- Back of the card(answer) is the second line
- Examples
  * Question 1
  Answer 1
  * Question 2
  Answer 2

Guidelines:
- Make flashcards only on the most important information, they should be focused and precise.
- Make sure the questions are clear and easy to understand
- Make the answers very concise, precise and consistent
- Make sure the answer will require the human to do memory retrieval
- If the information is factual, try adding a relevant example or usecase
- If the information is a concept, try making different cards about Attributes and tendencies, Similarities and differences with other things, Parts and wholes, Causes and effects, Significance and implications.
- If it's practical information, add any pattern or example information if available
- Don't create binary prompts such as yes/no

Examples:
- Example 1
  * Where is the Dead Sea located?
  on the border between Israel and Jordan
- Example 2
  * What is the lowest point on the Earth’s surface?
  The Dead Sea shoreline
- Example 3
  * What is the average level on which the Dead Sea is located?
  400 meters (below sea level)
- Example 4
  * How long is the Dead Sea?
  70 km

Next message will be the content that you need to make flashcards out of. Do you understand my instructions?
```


## Anki settings {#anki-settings}

As a general rule if you can’t answer within about 10 seconds, it’s probably better to give up and show the answer than keep struggling to remember.


### Learning Step {#learning-step}

-   When learning new cards/relearning forgotten cards, Anki will show you the cards one or more times to help you memorize them.
-   Each `time` is called a `learning step`.
-   Default: 2 steps: 1m and 10m.


#### Buttons {#buttons}

-   Again: Moves the card back to the first step.
-   Hard: Repeats the current step.
-   Good: Moves the card to the next step.
-   Easy: Converts the card into a review card
