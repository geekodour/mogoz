## How memory works {#how-memory-works}

-   When you attempt to recall some knowledge from memory, the act of "retrieval" reinforce those memories. Don't think about your ex.
-   The learning produced by retrieval is called the “testing effect”. This is more about producing [learning]({{< relref "20220625160938-learning.md" >}}) rather than accessing learning.
-   If things are in your memory and you're doing creative work, it'll help me get into flow faster
-   Salience(Notability) typically fades over time. If you don’t soon have a chance to connect that new idea to something meaningful in your life, you may stop noticing opportunities so readily. SRS helps us leverage Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.


## Writing better prompts {#writing-better-prompts}

This is summarization of [this article](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/).


### Type of information {#type-of-information}


#### Factual {#factual}

-   Closed list, almost like an equation
-   Not about just being able to answer factual question
-   The idea has to spontaneously occur to you when it’s useful


#### Procedural {#procedural}

-   Explanation prompts are helpful, avoid rote learning and build a deeper understanding


#### Conceptual {#conceptual}

To internalize a concept, you need to understand its components and relationships. You can use the following lenses when constructing a prompt for a concept but **you don't necessarily have to use** all of them.

-   Attributes and tendencies
-   Similarities and differences
-   Parts and wholes
-   Causes and effects
-   Significance and implications


#### Practical {#practical}

-   Open lists: These are like tags(not anki tag). With this, you connect new ideas to old ones
-   Prompt: Focused on tagged items, linking instance-tag.
-   Prompt: About the tag itself, perhaps patterns etc.
-   Prompt: Fuzzy links by examples.


### Basic guidelines {#basic-guidelines}

-   You are giving your future self a "recurring" task
-   Prompts should collectively invoke retrieval practice of all the key details
-   **Don't do** pattern matching, even if it's a cloze. You are recalling the knowledge not the pattern to fill. Just balance it out.
-   **Don't do** binary prompts(Y/N). Better rephrase them as open ended questions, usually means linking it some example/implication.
-   **Don't** disrupt your review session if something wrong w the prompt, SRS apps allow "flagging". Use that feature and modify the prompt later, maybe holistically.
-   Optimize prompts for the "emotional connection" w your review session


#### Skills needed {#skills-needed}

1.  How to break things down to things that we need to know
2.  How to construct questions, that'll reinforce that knowledge (This involves interpretation)


#### Process of writing {#process-of-writing}

-   Iterative
    -   Since you are not sure what's important, it's hard to write good prompts on your first exposure to new ideas.
    -   Write iteratively. Come back, writing more prompts as you understand what’s most relevant.
-   When?
    -   Whenever you feel it
    -   While you read (for simple topics)
    -   In batch, after reading/highlighting (for topics that doing anki back and forth might be disruptive)
-   How much?
    -   Don't try to economize on prompts. Write more prompts than feels natural.
    -   No deep virtue in writing a prompt about every detail. Keep things limited to your curiosity, usefulness and interest


### Prompt types {#prompt-types}

-   Retrieval prompts
-   Creative prompts


#### Properties for retrieval prompts {#properties-for-retrieval-prompts}

<div class="warning small-text">

> -   Achieving these properties is mostly about writing **tightly-scoped questions**
> -   Important to break knowledge down into its discrete components
> -   SRS schedule will build those pieces back up as prompts
</div>

-   **Focused**: Q/A involving too much detail will dull concentration and do incomplete retrievals
-   **Precise**: Should be precise about what they’re asking for
-   **Consistent**: Should produce consistent answers. i.e lighting the same bulbs everytime.
-   **Tractable**: To avoid interference/churn/annoyance in your review sessions, write prompts which you can almost always answer correctly. Way to do is by **adding cues**
-   **Effortful**: Should actually involves retrieving the answer from memory


#### Properties of creative prompts {#properties-of-creative-prompts}

-   Objective is not memory but to change behavior and invoke new thoughts
-   Creative prompts are more like a textbook exercise. Goal itself is to avoid retrieval.
-   You remember information better when you generated it yourself. (generation effect)
