## OAuth (Open Authorization) {#oauth--open-authorization}

-   OAuth 2.1 Spec : <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-07>
-   Framework that provides clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner.
-   It's an Authorization only thing. i.e most times assumes parties communicating are trusted already.
-   It **does NOT** deal with user registration, password recovery, changing a password or email address and so on.
-   [OIDC (OpenID Connect)]({{< relref "20230301191046-authentication.md#oidc--openid-connect" >}})'s parent: OIDC is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0.


### Some usecases {#some-usecases}

-   Allow third parties access to your data e.g. Facebook data (`OAuth2`).
-   Allow third parties to authenticate you via your social acc e.g. Facebook account (`OpenID Connect`).
-   Allow third parties to access your users data safely etc. (`OAuth2`)

-   OAuth 1.0 was published as RFC 5849 in 2010
-   OAuth 2.0 was published as RFC 6749 in 2012
-   OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework is in draft stage, Consolidates OAuth 2.0 and adds best practices.


## PKCE {#pkce}

-   Pronounced: "Pixie"
-   Problem: `Authorization server` needs to know that the correct application is requesting for an `access token`. Normally, `client_secret` solves this. BUT! we cannot use `client_secret` for `SPAs` and `mobile apps`.
-   Solution: PKCE
    -   Your application generates a `random secret` **per authorization request**
    -   `SHA256(random secret)` is sent in the first authorization request to the `OAuth server`
    -   When the exchange of `Authorization Code` for `Access token` happens, `random secret` is sent and now the `OAuth Server` can compare two hashes.


## Front channel &amp; Back channel {#front-channel-and-back-channel}


### Front channel {#front-channel}

The indirect communication between the `client` and the `authorization endpoint` via the `user agent` and based on `HTTP redirects`

### Back channel {#back-channel}

The direct communication between the `client` and the `token endpoint`.
