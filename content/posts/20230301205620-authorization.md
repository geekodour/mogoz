## OAuth (Open Authorization) {#oauth--open-authorization}

-   OAuth 2.1 Spec : <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-07>
-   Framework that provides clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner.
-   It's an Authorization only thing. i.e most times assumes parties communicating are trusted already.
-   It **does NOT** deal with user registration, password recovery, changing a password or email address and so on.
-   [OIDC (OpenID Connect)]({{< relref "20230301191046-authentication.md#oidc--openid-connect" >}})'s parent: OIDC is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0.


### Some usecases {#some-usecases}

-   Allow third parties access to your data e.g. Facebook data (`OAuth2`).
-   Allow third parties to authenticate you via your social acc e.g. Facebook account (`OpenID Connect`).
-   Allow third parties to access your users data safely etc. (`OAuth2`)

-   OAuth 1.0 was published as RFC 5849 in 2010
-   OAuth 2.0 was published as RFC 6749 in 2012
-   OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework is in draft stage, Consolidates OAuth 2.0 and adds best practices.


## Flows {#flows}


### Implicit Flow (deprecated) {#implicit-flow--deprecated}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/20230301205620-authorization-107426422.png" >}}

-   Issues
    -   Access token is sent over in the url
    -   No Authorization Code
    -   Cannot have refresh token


### PKCE {#pkce}

-   Problem: `Authorization server` needs to know that the correct application is requesting for an `access token`. Normally, `client_secret` solves this. BUT! we cannot use `client_secret` for `SPAs` and `mobile apps`. We can use the Implicit flow but PKCE is just better.
-   Solution: PKCE

    ![](/ox-hugo/20230301205620-authorization-1157195301.png)
    -   The application generates code challenge and code verifier
    -   Uses code challenge to get one time auth code
    -   Uses auth code and code verifier to get access token and refresh token


## Front channel &amp; Back channel {#front-channel-and-back-channel}


### Front channel {#front-channel}

The indirect communication between the `client` and the `authorization endpoint` via the `user agent` and based on `HTTP redirects`

### Back channel {#back-channel}
