I'm [Hrishikesh](<https://www.geekodour.org/>), and you've chanced upon my [braindump](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).
This website contains my working notes accumulated over some years. They're in a
really messy transition state: most of them are literature notes, and there are
close to no conceptual notes, which I intend to start taking soon.

While I do maintain copious notes on various topics, this is not a blog, and
neither is it meant for public reading. I use this site mostly to revise my
notes and search through them when I’m on a phone or a tablet.

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping
around by going to the [full index](/posts/).

Have fun!
