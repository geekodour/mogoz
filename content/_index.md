I'm [Hrishikesh](<https://www.geekodour.org/>), and you've chanced upon my [braindump](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). This website contains my working notes accumulated over some years. They're in a really messy state and probably will be like this, it's the nature of these notes. I use [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) to maintain this wiki and I am still [learning]({{< relref "20220625160938-learning.md" >}}) how to use this thing properly. I can see that it's pretty powerful, esp. within emacs.

While I do maintain copious notes on various topics, this is not a blog, and neither is it meant for public reading. I use this site mostly to revise my notes and search through them when I‚Äôm on my phone.

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping around by going to the [full index](/posts/) or the [latest page](/latest).

Have fun!


## Improvements {#improvements}

-   [ ] I have a few(more than a few) tables in this wiki and it's getting hard to manage them as org-mode tables, It'll be nice to have all of them into a sqlite store and then query the db inside org-files and create the tables. This way management will have a nice interface and I will not have to worry about formatting etc. I might be able to do it with existing packages if not, will have to write one.
-   [ ] It's safe to say attaching PDFs is not possible yet plus it's not properly organized etc. (We need a PDF dump kind of thing to which we can link to, i think i have some similar idea listed in ideas.org or something)
-   [ ] Linking tldraw files, currently it's a pain-point to have to export/import stuff.
-   [ ] Creating anki card is nice with [this](https://github.com/s-kostyaev/ellama/pull/10) but it can be improved. This can also be extended to do semantic search over the wiki.
