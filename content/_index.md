I'm [Hrishikesh](<https://www.geekodour.org/>), and you've chanced upon my [braindump](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). This website contains my working notes accumulated over some years. They're in a really messy state and probably will be like this, it's the nature of these notes. I use [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) to maintain this wiki and I am still [learning]({{< relref "20220625160938-learning.md" >}}) how to use this thing properly. I can see that it's pretty powerful, esp. within emacs.

While I do maintain copious notes on various topics, this is not a blog, and neither is it meant for public reading. I use this site mostly to revise my notes and search through them when I‚Äôm on my phone.

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping around by going to the [full index](/posts/).

Have fun!
