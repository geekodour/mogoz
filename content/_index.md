This really do be the homepage pooooop222 jj

I'm [Hrishikesh](<https://www.geekodour.org/>), and you've chanced upon my braindump.
This website contains my working notes accumulated over some years. They're in a
really messy transition state: most of them are literature notes, and there are
close to no conceptual notes, which I intend to start taking soon.

While I do maintain copious notes on various topics, this is not a blog, and
neither is it meant for public reading. I use this site mostly to revise my
notes and search through them when I’m on a phone or a tablet. If you’d like
to use the interview prep roadmap, feel free, but note that it is a roadmap
that works for me (at least I’d like to assume so, but I’ll update this if I
Get the job I’m looking for), and might not work for you.

these principles:

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping
around by going to the [full index](/posts/).

Have fun!
